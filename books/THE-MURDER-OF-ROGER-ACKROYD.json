        "5": "It was just a few minutes after nine when I reached home once more. I\nopened the front door with my latch-key, and purposely delayed a few\nmoments in the hall, hanging up my hat and the light overcoat that\nI had deemed a wise precaution against the chill of an early autumn\nmorning. To tell the truth, I was considerably upset and worried. I am\nnot going to pretend that at that moment I foresaw the events of the\nnext few weeks. I emphatically did not do so. But my instinct told me\n",

        "7": "An unnecessary question, since who else could it be? To tell the\ntruth, it was precisely my sister Caroline who was the cause of my few\nminutes\u2019 delay. The motto of the mongoose family, so Mr. Kipling tells\nus, is: \u201cGo and find out.\u201d If Caroline ever adopts a crest, I should\n",
        "8": "certainly suggest a mongoose rampant. One might omit the first part\nof the motto. Caroline can do any amount of finding out by sitting\nplacidly at home. I don\u2019t know how she manages it, but there it is. I\n",
        "9": "suspect that the servants and the tradesmen constitute her Intelligence\nCorps. When she goes out, it is not to gather in information, but to\nspread it. At that, too, she is amazingly expert.\nIt was really this last named trait of hers which was causing me these\npangs of indecision. Whatever I told Caroline now concerning the demise\n",
        "10": "of Mrs. Ferrars would be common knowledge all over the village within\nthe space of an hour and a half. As a professional man, I naturally\naim at discretion. Therefore I have got into the habit of continually\n",
        "11": "withholding all information possible from my sister. She usually finds\nout just the same, but I have the moral satisfaction of knowing that I\nam in no way to blame.\nMrs. Ferrars\u2019 husband died just over a year ago, and Caroline has\n",
        "12": "constantly asserted, without the least foundation for the assertion,\nthat his wife poisoned him.\nShe scorns my invariable rejoinder that Mr. Ferrars died of acute\ngastritis, helped on by habitual over-indulgence in alcoholic\nbeverages. The symptoms of gastritis and arsenical poisoning are not,\n",
        "13": "I agree, unlike, but Caroline bases her accusation on quite different\nlines.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve only got to look at her,\u201d I have heard her say.\nMrs. Ferrars, though not in her first youth, was a very attractive\n",
        "14": "woman, and her clothes, though simple, always seemed to fit her very\nwell, but all the same, lots of women buy their clothes in Paris and\nhave not, on that account, necessarily poisoned their husbands.\nAs I stood hesitating in the hall, with all this passing through my\nmind, Caroline\u2019s voice came again, with a sharper note in it.\n\u201cWhat on earth are you doing out there, James? Why don\u2019t you come and\n",
        "15": "get your breakfast?\u201d\n\u201cJust coming, my dear,\u201d I said hastily. \u201cI\u2019ve been hanging up my\novercoat.\u201d\n",
        "16": "\u201cYou could have hung up half a dozen overcoats in this time.\u201d\nShe was quite right. I could have.\nI walked into the dining-room, gave Caroline the accustomed peck on the\ncheek, and sat down to eggs and bacon. The bacon was rather cold.\n",
        "17": "\u201cYou\u2019ve had an early call,\u201d remarked Caroline.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cKing\u2019s Paddock. Mrs. Ferrars.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d said my sister.\n",
        "18": "\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n\u201cAnnie told me.\u201d\nAnnie is the house parlormaid. A nice girl, but an inveterate talker.\n",
        "19": "There was a pause. I continued to eat eggs and bacon. My sister\u2019s nose,\nwhich is long and thin, quivered a little at the tip, as it always does\nwhen she is interested or excited over anything.\n\u201cWell?\u201d she demanded.\n",
        "20": "\u201cA bad business. Nothing to be done. Must have died in her sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d said my sister again.\nThis time I was annoyed.\n",
        "21": "\u201cYou can\u2019t know,\u201d I snapped. \u201cI didn\u2019t know myself until I got there,\nand I haven\u2019t mentioned it to a soul yet. If that girl Annie knows, she\nmust be a clairvoyant.\u201d\n",
        "22": "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Annie who told me. It was the milkman. He had it from the\nFerrars\u2019 cook.\u201d\nAs I say, there is no need for Caroline to go out to get information.\n",
        "23": "She sits at home, and it comes to her.\nMy sister continued:\n\u201cWhat did she die of? Heart failure?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t the milkman tell you that?\u201d I inquired sarcastically.\n",
        "24": "Sarcasm is wasted on Caroline. She takes it seriously and answers\naccordingly.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t know,\u201d she explained.\n",
        "25": "After all, Caroline was bound to hear sooner or later. She might as\nwell hear from me.\n\u201cShe died of an overdose of veronal. She\u2019s been taking it lately for\n",
        "26": "sleeplessness. Must have taken too much.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d said Caroline immediately. \u201cShe took it on purpose. Don\u2019t\ntell me!\u201d\n",
        "27": "It is odd how, when you have a secret belief of your own which you do\nnot wish to acknowledge, the voicing of it by some one else will rouse\nyou to a fury of denial. I burst immediately into indignant speech.\n\u201cThere you go again,\u201d I said. \u201cRushing along without rhyme or reason.\nWhy on earth should Mrs. Ferrars wish to commit suicide? A widow,\n",
        "28": "fairly young still, very well off, good health, and nothing to do but\nenjoy life. It\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all. Even you must have noticed how different she has been\nlooking lately. It\u2019s been coming on for the last six months. She\u2019s\n",
        "29": "looked positively hag-ridden. And you have just admitted that she\nhasn\u2019t been able to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your diagnosis?\u201d I demanded coldly. \u201cAn unfortunate love\n",
        "30": "affair, I suppose?\u201d\nMy sister shook her head.\n\u201c_Remorse_,\u201d she said, with great gusto.\n",
        "31": "\u201cRemorse?\u201d\n\u201cYes. You never would believe me when I told you she poisoned her\nhusband. I\u2019m more than ever convinced of it now.\u201d\n",
        "32": "\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re very logical,\u201d I objected. \u201cSurely if a woman\ncommitted a crime like murder, she\u2019d be sufficiently cold-blooded to\nenjoy the fruits of it without any weak-minded sentimentality such as\nrepentance.\u201d\nCaroline shook her head.\n",
        "33": "\u201cThere probably are women like that\u2014but Mrs. Ferrars wasn\u2019t one of\nthem. She was a mass of nerves. An overmastering impulse drove her on\nto get rid of her husband because she was the sort of person who simply\ncan\u2019t endure suffering of any kind, and there\u2019s no doubt that the wife\nof a man like Ashley Ferrars must have had to suffer a good deal\u2014\u2014\u201d\nI nodded.\n",
        "34": "\u201cAnd ever since she\u2019s been haunted by what she did. I can\u2019t help\nfeeling sorry for her.\u201d\nI don\u2019t think Caroline ever felt sorry for Mrs. Ferrars whilst she was\n",
        "35": "alive. Now that she has gone where (presumably) Paris frocks can no\nlonger be worn, Caroline is prepared to indulge in the softer emotions\nof pity and comprehension.\nI told her firmly that her whole idea was nonsense. I was all the more\n",
        "36": "firm because I secretly agreed with some part, at least, of what she\nhad said. But it is all wrong that Caroline should arrive at the truth\nsimply by a kind of inspired guesswork. I wasn\u2019t going to encourage\nthat sort of thing. She will go round the village airing her views, and\n",
        "37": "every one will think that she is doing so on medical data supplied by\nme. Life is very trying.\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d said Caroline, in reply to my strictures. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. Ten\nto one she\u2019s left a letter confessing everything.\u201d\n",
        "38": "\u201cShe didn\u2019t leave a letter of any kind,\u201d I said sharply, and not seeing\nwhere the admission was going to land me.\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Caroline. \u201cSo you _did_ inquire about that, did you? I\nbelieve, James, that in your heart of hearts, you think very much as I\ndo. You\u2019re a precious old humbug.\u201d\n",
        "39": "\u201cOne always has to take the possibility of suicide into consideration,\u201d\nI said repressively.\n\u201cWill there be an inquest?\u201d\n\u201cThere may be. It all depends. If I am able to declare myself\n",
        "40": "absolutely satisfied that the overdose was taken accidentally, an\ninquest might be dispensed with.\u201d\n\u201cAnd are you absolutely satisfied?\u201d asked my sister shrewdly.\nI did not answer, but got up from table.\n",
        "41": "                              CHAPTER II\n                       WHO\u2019S WHO IN KING\u2019S ABBOT\nBefore I proceed further with what I said to Caroline and what Caroline\nsaid to me, it might be as well to give some idea of what I should\ndescribe as our local geography. Our village, King\u2019s Abbot, is, I\nimagine, very much like any other village. Our big town is Cranchester,\nnine miles away. We have a large railway station, a small post office,\n",
        "42": "and two rival \u201cGeneral Stores.\u201d Able-bodied men are apt to leave the\nplace early in life, but we are rich in unmarried ladies and retired\nmilitary officers. Our hobbies and recreations can be summed up in the\none word, \u201cgossip.\u201d\n",
        "43": "There are only two houses of any importance in King\u2019s Abbot. One\nis King\u2019s Paddock, left to Mrs. Ferrars by her late husband. The\nother, Fernly Park, is owned by Roger Ackroyd. Ackroyd has always\n",
        "44": "interested me by being a man more impossibly like a country squire\nthan any country squire could really be. He reminds one of the\nred-faced sportsmen who always appeared early in the first act of an\nold-fashioned musical comedy, the setting being the village green. They\nusually sang a song about going up to London. Nowadays we have revues,\n",
        "45": "and the country squire has died out of musical fashion.\nOf course, Ackroyd is not really a country squire. He is an immensely\nsuccessful manufacturer of (I think) wagon wheels. He is a man of\n",
        "46": "nearly fifty years of age, rubicund of face and genial of manner.\nHe is hand and glove with the vicar, subscribes liberally to parish\nfunds (though rumor has it that he is extremely mean in personal\nexpenditure), encourages cricket matches, Lads\u2019 Clubs, and Disabled\nSoldiers\u2019 Institutes. He is, in fact, the life and soul of our peaceful\nvillage of King\u2019s Abbot.\n",
        "47": "Now when Roger Ackroyd was a lad of twenty-one, he fell in love with,\nand married, a beautiful woman some five or six years his senior. Her\nname was Paton, and she was a widow with one child. The history of the\nmarriage was short and painful. To put it bluntly, Mrs. Ackroyd was\n",
        "48": "a dipsomaniac. She succeeded in drinking herself into her grave four\nyears after her marriage.\nIn the years that followed, Ackroyd showed no disposition to make a\nsecond matrimonial adventure. His wife\u2019s child by her first marriage\n",
        "49": "was only seven years old when his mother died. He is now twenty-five.\nAckroyd has always regarded him as his own son, and has brought him up\naccordingly, but he has been a wild lad and a continual source of worry\nand trouble to his stepfather. Nevertheless we are all very fond of\nRalph Paton in King\u2019s Abbot. He is such a good-looking youngster for\n",
        "50": "one thing.\nAs I said before, we are ready enough to gossip in our village.\nEverybody noticed from the first that Ackroyd and Mrs. Ferrars got on\n",
        "51": "very well together. After her husband\u2019s death, the intimacy became\nmore marked. They were always seen about together, and it was freely\nconjectured that at the end of her period of mourning, Mrs. Ferrars\n",
        "52": "would become Mrs. Roger Ackroyd. It was felt, indeed, that there was a\ncertain fitness in the thing. Roger Ackroyd\u2019s wife had admittedly died\nof drink. Ashley Ferrars had been a drunkard for many years before his\n",

It was only fitting that these two victims of alcoholic excess\nshould make up to each other for all that they had previously endured\nat the hands of their former spouses.\nThe Ferrars only came to live here just over a year ago, but a halo of\ngossip has surrounded Ackroyd for many years past. All the time that\n",
        "54": "Ralph Paton was growing up to manhood, a series of lady housekeepers\npresided over Ackroyd\u2019s establishment, and each in turn was regarded\nwith lively suspicion by Caroline and her cronies. It is not too\nmuch to say that for at least fifteen years the whole village has\nconfidently expected Ackroyd to marry one of his housekeepers. The last\nof them, a redoubtable lady called Miss Russell, has reigned undisputed\nfor five years, twice as long as any of her predecessors. It is felt\n",
        "55": "that but for the advent of Mrs. Ferrars, Ackroyd could hardly have\nescaped. That\u2014and one other factor\u2014the unexpected arrival of a widowed\nsister-in-law with her daughter from Canada. Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd, widow\n",

The bread of charity is so bitter, is\n",

        "61": "Surely, if she had done so, she would have left some word behind to\nsay what she contemplated doing?

They covet the limelight.\nWhen had I last seen her? Not for over a week. Her manner then had been\n",
        "62": "normal enough considering\u2014well\u2014considering everything.\nThen I suddenly remembered that I had seen her, though not to speak\nto, only yesterday. She had been walking with Ralph Paton, and I had\nbeen surprised because I had had no idea that he was likely to be in\nKing\u2019s Abbot. I thought, indeed, that he had quarreled finally with\n",

        "70": "Ackroyd stared blankly at me as though he hardly understood. I began to\nrealize that there must be something very wrong indeed somewhere. I had\nnever seen Ackroyd so upset before.\n",
        "71": "\u201cRalph?\u201d he said vaguely. \u201cOh! no, it\u2019s not Ralph. Ralph\u2019s in\nLondon\u2014\u2014Damn! Here\u2019s old Miss Ganett coming. I don\u2019t want to have to\ntalk to her about this ghastly business. See you to-night, Sheppard.\n",

It left\nher in difficulties, and before she could pull herself together, I had\npassed on.\nI went home thoughtful, to find several patients waiting for me in the\nsurgery.\n",
        "79": "I had dismissed the last of them, as I thought, and was just\ncontemplating a few minutes in the garden before lunch when I perceived\none more patient waiting for me.

She asked me if I had any in my poison cupboard,\nand when I replied in the negative I fancy I fell in her estimation.\nShe said she must be getting back, and I saw her out at the surgery\ndoor just as the luncheon gong went.\n",
