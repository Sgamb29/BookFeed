I remember him looking round the cove and whistling to himself\nas he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so\noften afterwards:\n          \u201cFifteen men on the dead man\u2019s chest--\n             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\u201d\n",
        "17": "in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and\nbroken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of\nstick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared,\ncalled roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him,\nhe drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still\nlooking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.\n",
        "18": "\u201cThis is a handy cove,\u201d says he at length; \u201cand a pleasant sittyated\ngrog-shop. Much company, mate?\u201d\nMy father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d said he, \u201cthis is the berth for me. Here you, matey,\u201d he\n",
        "19": "cried to the man who trundled the barrow; \u201cbring up alongside and help\nup my chest. I\u2019ll stay here a bit,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m a plain man; rum\nand bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch\nships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I\nsee what you\u2019re at--there\u201d; and he threw down three or four gold pieces\non the threshold. \u201cYou can tell me when I\u2019ve worked through that,\u201d says\n",
        "20": "he, looking as fierce as a commander.\nAnd indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none\nof the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like\na mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike. The man who came\nwith the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at\nthe Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along the\ncoast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as\nlonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence. And\n",
        "21": "that was all we could learn of our guest.\nHe was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the cove or\nupon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner\nof the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong. Mostly\n",
        "22": "he would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and\nblow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came\nabout our house soon learned to let him be. Every day when he came back\nfrom his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the\nroad. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind\nthat made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was\ndesirous to avoid them. When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow\n",
        "23": "(as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he\nwould look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the\nparlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such\nwas present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, for\nI was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside one day\nand promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I\nwould only keep my \u201cweather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg\u201d\n and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough when the first\n",
        "24": "of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would only\nblow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was\nout he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, and\nrepeat his orders to look out for \u201cthe seafaring man with one leg.\u201d\nHow that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you. On\nstormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house and\nthe surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a\nthousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions. Now the leg\n",
        "25": "would be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous\nkind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the\nmiddle of his body. To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and\nditch was the worst of nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear for\nmy monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies.\n",
        "26": "But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one\nleg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who\nknew him. There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water\nthan his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his\nwicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call\nfor glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his\nstories or bear a chorus to his singing. Often I have heard the house\nshaking with \u201cYo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum,\u201d all the neighbours joining\nin for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing\nlouder than the other to avoid remark. For in these fits he was the most\n",
        "27": "overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for\nsilence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question,\nor sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not\nfollowing his story. Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he\nhad drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed.\nHis stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful stories\n",
        "28": "they were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and\nthe Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his\nown account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men\nthat God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told\nthese stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the\ncrimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be\nruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over\nand put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his\npresence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking\n",
        "29": "back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country\nlife, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to\nadmire him, calling him a \u201ctrue sea-dog\u201d and a \u201creal old salt\u201d and\nsuch like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England\nterrible at sea.\nIn one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week\nafter week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had\nbeen long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to\ninsist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through\nhis nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor\nfather out of the room. I have seen him wringing his hands after such a\n",
        "30": "rebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have\ngreatly hastened his early and unhappy death.\nAll the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his\ndress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. One of the cocks of his\nhat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it\nwas a great annoyance when it blew. I remember the appearance of his\n",
        "31": "coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before\nthe end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or received a letter,\nand he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the\nmost part, only when drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us had\never seen open.\n",
        "32": "He was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor\nfather was far gone in a decline that took him off. Dr. Livesey came\nlate one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from my\nmother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should\ncome down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old Benbow. I\nfollowed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright\ndoctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and\npleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all,\nwith that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting,\nfar gone in rum, with his arms on the table. Suddenly he--the captain,\n",
        "33": "that is--began to pipe up his eternal song:\n          \u201cFifteen men on the dead man\u2019s chest--\n             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\n           Drink and the devil had done for the rest--\n             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\u201d\nAt first I had supposed \u201cthe dead man\u2019s chest\u201d to be that identical big\nbox of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled\nin my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man. But by this\n",
        "34": "time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it\nwas new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it\ndid not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite\nangrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on\na new cure for the rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain gradually\nbrightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon\nthe table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence. The voices\n",
        "35": "stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey\u2019s; he went on as before speaking\nclear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or\ntwo. The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again,\nglared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath,\n\u201cSilence, there, between decks!\u201d\n",
        "36": "\u201cWere you addressing me, sir?\u201d says the doctor; and when the ruffian had\ntold him, with another oath, that this was so, \u201cI have only one thing to\nsay to you, sir,\u201d replies the doctor, \u201cthat if you keep on drinking rum,\nthe world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!\u201d\nThe old fellow\u2019s fury was awful. He sprang to his feet, drew and opened\n",
        "37": "a sailor\u2019s clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand,\nthreatened to pin the doctor to the wall.\nThe doctor never so much as moved. He spoke to him as before, over his\nshoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the\nroom might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: \u201cIf you do not put that\nknife this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shall\nhang at the next assizes.\u201d\n",
        "38": "Then followed a battle of looks between them, but the captain soon\nknuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like\na beaten dog.\n\u201cAnd now, sir,\u201d continued the doctor, \u201csince I now know there\u2019s such a\nfellow in my district, you may count I\u2019ll have an eye upon you day and\nnight. I\u2019m not a doctor only; I\u2019m a magistrate; and if I catch a breath\nof complaint against you, if it\u2019s only for a piece of incivility like\ntonight\u2019s, I\u2019ll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed\nout of this. Let that suffice.\u201d\n",
        "39": "Soon after, Dr. Livesey\u2019s horse came to the door and he rode away, but\nthe captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come.\n2\nBlack Dog Appears and Disappears\nIT was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the\nmysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you\nwill see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard\n",
        "40": "frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor\nfather was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily, and my mother\nand I had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without\npaying much regard to our unpleasant guest.\nIt was one January morning, very early--a pinching, frosty morning--the\ncove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones,\nthe sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to\nseaward. The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the\n",
        "41": "beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat,\nhis brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I\nremember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and\nthe last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort\nof indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr. Livesey.\nWell, mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the\nbreakfast-table against the captain\u2019s return when the parlour door\nopened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before. He\n",
        "42": "was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, and\nthough he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. I\nhad always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I\nremember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and yet he had a\nsmack of the sea about him too.\n",
        "43": "I asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but\nas I was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table\nand motioned me to draw near. I paused where I was, with my napkin in my\nhand.\n\u201cCome here, sonny,\u201d says he. \u201cCome nearer here.\u201d\n",
        "44": "I took a step nearer.\n\u201cIs this here table for my mate Bill?\u201d he asked with a kind of leer.\nI told him I did not know his mate Bill, and this was for a person who\nstayed in our house whom we called the captain.\n",
        "45": "\u201cWell,\u201d said he, \u201cmy mate Bill would be called the captain, as like\nas not. He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him,\nparticularly in drink, has my mate Bill. We\u2019ll put it, for argument\nlike, that your captain has a cut on one cheek--and we\u2019ll put it, if you\nlike, that that cheek\u2019s the right one. Ah, well! I told you. Now, is my\n",
        "46": "mate Bill in this here house?\u201d\nI told him he was out walking.\n\u201cWhich way, sonny? Which way is he gone?\u201d\n",
        "47": "And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was\nlikely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other questions,\n\u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cthis\u2019ll be as good as drink to my mate Bill.\u201d\nThe expression of his face as he said these words was not at all\npleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was\nmistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. But it was no affair of\nmine, I thought; and besides, it was difficult to know what to do. The\n",
        "48": "stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round the\ncorner like a cat waiting for a mouse. Once I stepped out myself into\nthe road, but he immediately called me back, and as I did not obey quick\nenough for his fancy, a most horrible change came over his tallowy face,\nand he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump. As soon as I\nwas back again he returned to his former manner, half fawning, half\nsneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me I was a good boy and he had\ntaken quite a fancy to me. \u201cI have a son of my own,\u201d said he, \u201cas like\n",
        "49": "you as two blocks, and he\u2019s all the pride of my \u2019art. But the great\nthing for boys is discipline, sonny--discipline. Now, if you had sailed\nalong of Bill, you wouldn\u2019t have stood there to be spoke to twice--not\nyou. That was never Bill\u2019s way, nor the way of sich as sailed with him.\n",
        "50": "And here, sure enough, is my mate Bill, with a spy-glass under his arm,\nbless his old \u2019art, to be sure. You and me\u2019ll just go back into the\nparlour, sonny, and get behind the door, and we\u2019ll give Bill a little\nsurprise--bless his \u2019art, I say again.\u201d\nSo saying, the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me\nbehind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door. I\n",
        "51": "was very uneasy and alarmed, as you may fancy, and it rather added to my\nfears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself. He\ncleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath;\nand all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt\nwhat we used to call a lump in the throat.\nAt last in strode the captain, slammed the door behind him, without\nlooking to the right or left, and marched straight across the room to\nwhere his breakfast awaited him.\n",
        "52": "\u201cBill,\u201d said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make\nbold and big.\nThe captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had\ngone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a\nman who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anything\ncan be; and upon my word, I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn\nso old and sick.\n\u201cCome, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, Bill, surely,\u201d said\nthe stranger.\n",
        "53": "The captain made a sort of gasp.\n\u201cBlack Dog!\u201d said he.\n\u201cAnd who else?\u201d returned the other, getting more at his ease. \u201cBlack\n",
        "54": "Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral\nBenbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since\nI lost them two talons,\u201d holding up his mutilated hand.\n\u201cNow, look here,\u201d said the captain; \u201cyou\u2019ve run me down; here I am;\nwell, then, speak up; what is it?\u201d\n",

Then my mother\ngot a candle in the bar, and holding each other\u2019s hands, we advanced\ninto the parlour. He lay as we had left him, on his back, with his eyes\n",
        "115": "open and one arm stretched out.\n\u201cDraw down the blind, Jim,\u201d whispered my mother; \u201cthey might come and\nwatch outside. And now,\u201d said she when I had done so, \u201cwe have to get\nthe key off _that;_ and who\u2019s to touch it, I should like to know!\u201d and she\n",
        "116": "gave a kind of sob as she said the words.\nI went down on my knees at once. On the floor close to his hand there\nwas a little round of paper, blackened on the one side. I could not\n",
        "117": "doubt that this was the _black spot;_ and taking it up, I found written\non the other side, in a very good, clear hand, this short message: \u201cYou\nhave till ten tonight.\u201d\n\u201cHe had till ten, Mother,\u201d said I; and just as I said it, our old clock\nbegan striking. This sudden noise startled us shockingly; but the news\nwas good, for it was only six.\n",
        "118": "\u201cNow, Jim,\u201d she said, \u201cthat key.\u201d\nI felt in his pockets, one after another. A few small coins, a thimble,\nand some thread and big needles, a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away\nat the end, his gully with the crooked handle, a pocket compass, and a\ntinder box were all that they contained, and I began to despair.\n",
        "119": "\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s round his neck,\u201d suggested my mother.\nOvercoming a strong repugnance, I tore open his shirt at the neck, and\nthere, sure enough, hanging to a bit of tarry string, which I cut with\nhis own gully, we found the key. At this triumph we were filled with\nhope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had\nslept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival.\n",
        "120": "It was like any other seaman\u2019s chest on the outside, the initial \u201cB\u201d\n burned on the top of it with a hot iron, and the corners somewhat\nsmashed and broken as by long, rough usage.\n\u201cGive me the key,\u201d said my mother; and though the lock was very stiff,\nshe had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling.\nA strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior, but nothing\nwas to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes, carefully\nbrushed and folded. They had never been worn, my mother said. Under\n",
        "121": "that, the miscellany began--a quadrant, a tin canikin, several sticks of\ntobacco, two brace of very handsome pistols, a piece of bar silver, an\nold Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of\nforeign make, a pair of compasses mounted with brass, and five or six\ncurious West Indian shells. I have often wondered since why he should\nhave carried about these shells with him in his wandering, guilty, and\nhunted life.\nIn the meantime, we had found nothing of any value but the silver and\nthe trinkets, and neither of these were in our way. Underneath there\n",
        "122": "was an old boat-cloak, whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar. My\nmother pulled it up with impatience, and there lay before us, the last\nthings in the chest, a bundle tied up in oilcloth, and looking like\npapers, and a canvas bag that gave forth, at a touch, the jingle of\ngold.\n\u201cI\u2019ll show these rogues that I\u2019m an honest woman,\u201d said my mother. \u201cI\u2019ll\n",
        "123": "have my dues, and not a farthing over. Hold Mrs. Crossley\u2019s bag.\u201d And\nshe began to count over the amount of the captain\u2019s score from the\nsailor\u2019s bag into the one that I was holding.\nIt was a long, difficult business, for the coins were of all countries\nand sizes--doubloons, and louis d\u2019ors, and guineas, and pieces of eight,\nand I know not what besides, all shaken together at random. The guineas,\n",
        "124": "too, were about the scarcest, and it was with these only that my mother\nknew how to make her count.\nWhen we were about half-way through, I suddenly put my hand upon her\narm, for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my\nheart into my mouth--the tap-tapping of the blind man\u2019s stick upon the\nfrozen road. It drew nearer and nearer, while we sat holding our breath.\nThen it struck sharp on the inn door, and then we could hear the handle\nbeing turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter;\nand then there was a long time of silence both within and without.\n",
        "125": "At last the tapping recommenced, and, to our indescribable joy and\ngratitude, died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard.\n\u201cMother,\u201d said I, \u201ctake the whole and let\u2019s be going,\u201d for I was sure\nthe bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole\nhornet\u2019s nest about our ears, though how thankful I was that I had\nbolted it, none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man.\nBut my mother, frightened as she was, would not consent to take a\nfraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be\ncontent with less. It was not yet seven, she said, by a long way; she\n",
        "126": "knew her rights and she would have them; and she was still arguing with\nme when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill. That\nwas enough, and more than enough, for both of us.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take what I have,\u201d she said, jumping to her feet.\n",
        "127": "\u201cAnd I\u2019ll take this to square the count,\u201d said I, picking up the oilskin\npacket.\nNext moment we were both groping downstairs, leaving the candle by\nthe empty chest; and the next we had opened the door and were in full\nretreat. We had not started a moment too soon. The fog was rapidly\ndispersing; already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on\neither side; and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round\nthe tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the\nfirst steps of our escape. Far less than half-way to the hamlet, very\n",
        "128": "little beyond the bottom of the hill, we must come forth into the\nmoonlight. Nor was this all, for the sound of several footsteps running\ncame already to our ears, and as we looked back in their direction, a\nlight tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of\nthe newcomers carried a lantern.\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d said my mother suddenly, \u201ctake the money and run on. I am\n",
        "129": "going to faint.\u201d\nThis was certainly the end for both of us, I thought. How I cursed the\ncowardice of the neighbours; how I blamed my poor mother for her honesty\nand her greed, for her past foolhardiness and present weakness! We were\n",
        "130": "just at the little bridge, by good fortune; and I helped her, tottering\nas she was, to the edge of the bank, where, sure enough, she gave a sigh\nand fell on my shoulder. I do not know how I found the strength to do it\nat all, and I am afraid it was roughly done, but I managed to drag her\ndown the bank and a little way under the arch. Farther I could not move\nher, for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it.\n",
        "131": "So there we had to stay--my mother almost entirely exposed and both of\nus within earshot of the inn.\n5\nThe Last of the Blind Man\nMY curiosity, in a sense, was stronger than my fear, for I could not\nremain where I was, but crept back to the bank again, whence, sheltering\nmy head behind a bush of broom, I might command the road before our\ndoor. I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven\nor eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along\nthe road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. Three men ran\n",
        "132": "together, hand in hand; and I made out, even through the mist, that the\nmiddle man of this trio was the blind beggar. The next moment his voice\nshowed me that I was right.\n\u201cDown with the door!\u201d he cried.\n",
        "133": "\u201cAye, aye, sir!\u201d answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the\nAdmiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see\nthem pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were\nsurprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind\nman again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as\n",
        "134": "if he were afire with eagerness and rage.\n\u201cIn, in, in!\u201d he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.\nFour or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the\nformidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a\n",
        "135": "voice shouting from the house, \u201cBill\u2019s dead.\u201d\nBut the blind man swore at them again for their delay.\n\u201cSearch him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and\nget the chest,\u201d he cried.\n",
        "136": "I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the\nhouse must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of\nastonishment arose; the window of the captain\u2019s room was thrown open\nwith a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the\nmoonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the\nroad below him.\n\u201cPew,\u201d he cried, \u201cthey\u2019ve been before us. Someone\u2019s turned the chest out\n",
        "137": "alow and aloft.\u201d\n\u201cIs it there?\u201d roared Pew.\n\u201cThe money\u2019s there.\u201d\n",
        "138": "The blind man cursed the money.\n\u201cFlint\u2019s fist, I mean,\u201d he cried.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see it here nohow,\u201d returned the man.\n",
        "139": "\u201cHere, you below there, is it on Bill?\u201d cried the blind man again.\nAt that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search\nthe captain\u2019s body, came to the door of the inn. \u201cBill\u2019s been overhauled\na\u2019ready,\u201d said he; \u201cnothin\u2019 left.\u201d\n",
        "140": "\u201cIt\u2019s these people of the inn--it\u2019s that boy. I wish I had put his eyes\nout!\u201d cried the blind man, Pew. \u201cThere were no time ago--they had the\ndoor bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find \u2019em.\u201d\n",
        "141": "\u201cSure enough, they left their glim here,\u201d said the fellow from the\nwindow.\n\u201cScatter and find \u2019em! Rout the house out!\u201d reiterated Pew, striking\nwith his stick upon the road.\n",
        "142": "Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet\npounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the\nvery rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on\nthe road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just\nthe same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead\ncaptain\u2019s money was once more clearly audible through the night,\nbut this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man\u2019s\ntrumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found\nthat it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its\neffect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\n",
        "143": "\u201cThere\u2019s Dirk again,\u201d said one. \u201cTwice! We\u2019ll have to budge, mates.\u201d\n\u201cBudge, you skulk!\u201d cried Pew. \u201cDirk was a fool and a coward from the\nfirst--you wouldn\u2019t mind him. They must be close by; they can\u2019t be far;\n",
        "144": "you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver\nmy soul,\u201d he cried, \u201cif I had eyes!\u201d\nThis appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began\nto look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought,\nand with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest\nstood irresolute on the road.\n",
        "145": "\u201cYou have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You\u2019d\nbe as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it\u2019s here, and\nyou stand there skulking. There wasn\u2019t one of you dared face Bill, and\nI did it--a blind man!

        "146": "poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a\ncoach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch\nthem still.\u201d\n\u201cHang it, Pew, we\u2019ve got the doubloons!\u201d grumbled one.\n",
        "147": "\u201cThey might have hid the blessed thing,\u201d said another. \u201cTake the\nGeorges, Pew, and don\u2019t stand here squalling.\u201d\nSqualling was the word for it; Pew\u2019s anger rose so high at these\nobjections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand,\nhe struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded\nheavily on more than one.\n",
        "148": "These, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him\nin horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from\nhis grasp.\nThis quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging,\nanother sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the\nhamlet--the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a\npistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was\n",
        "149": "plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once\nand ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one\nslant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of\nthem remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic\nor out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he\nremained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping\nand calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few\nsteps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\u201d\n and other names, \u201cyou won\u2019t leave old Pew, mates--not old Pew!\u201d\n",
        "150": "Just then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders\ncame in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.\nAt this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for\nthe ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a\nsecond and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the\nnearest of the coming horses.\n",
        "151": "The rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that\nrang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him\nand passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face\nand moved no more.\n",
        "152": "I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any\nrate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One,\ntailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to\nDr. Livesey\u2019s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the\n",
        "153": "way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some\nnews of the lugger in Kitt\u2019s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance\nand set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance\nmy mother and I owed our preservation from death.\nPew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up\n",
        "154": "to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her\nback again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still\ncontinued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the\nsupervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt\u2019s Hole; but his men\nhad to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes\nsupporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was\nno great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the\nlugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A\nvoice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get\nsome lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his\narm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance\n",

        "402": "PART THREE--My Shore Adventure\n13\nHow My Shore Adventure Began\nTHE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was\naltogether changed. Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had\nmade a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed\nabout half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast.\nGrey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface. This even tint\n",
        "403": "was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands,\nand by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the others--some\nsingly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad.\nThe hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock.\nAll were strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass, which was by three or four\nhundred feet the tallest on the island, was likewise the strangest in\nconfiguration, running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly\ncut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on.\n",
        "404": "The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell. The booms\nwere tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and fro, and the\nwhole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a manufactory. I had\nto cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my\neyes, for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this\nstanding still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never\nlearned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an\nempty stomach.\n",
        "405": "Perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its\ngrey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we\ncould both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at\nleast, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were\nfishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone\nwould have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart\nsank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I\nhated the very thought of Treasure Island.\nWe had a dreary morning\u2019s work before us, for there was no sign of any\nwind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped\nthree or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow\npassage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of\nthe boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was sweltering,\n",
        "406": "and the men grumbled fiercely over their work. Anderson was in command\nof my boat, and instead of keeping the crew in order, he grumbled as\nloud as the worst.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said with an oath, \u201cit\u2019s not forever.\u201d\n",
        "407": "I thought this was a very bad sign, for up to that day the men had gone\nbriskly and willingly about their business; but the very sight of the\nisland had relaxed the cords of discipline.\nAll the way in, Long John stood by the steersman and conned the ship.\nHe knew the passage like the palm of his hand, and though the man in the\nchains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart, John never\nhesitated once.\n",
        "408": "\u201cThere\u2019s a strong scour with the ebb,\u201d he said, \u201cand this here passage\nhas been dug out, in a manner of speaking, with a spade.\u201d\nWe brought up just where the anchor was in the chart, about a third of\na mile from each shore, the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on\nthe other. The bottom was clean sand. The plunge of our anchor sent up\nclouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods, but in less than a\nminute they were down again and all was once more silent.\n",
        "409": "The place was entirely land-locked, buried in woods, the trees coming\nright down to high-water mark, the shores mostly flat, and the hilltops\nstanding round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre, one here, one\nthere. Two little rivers, or rather two swamps, emptied out into this\npond, as you might call it; and the foliage round that part of the shore\nhad a kind of poisonous brightness. From the ship we could see nothing\nof the house or stockade, for they were quite buried among trees; and if\nit had not been for the chart on the companion, we might have been the\nfirst that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the\nseas.\n",
        "410": "There was not a breath of air moving, nor a sound but that of the\nsurf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks\noutside. A peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage--a smell of\nsodden leaves and rotting tree trunks. I observed the doctor sniffing\nand sniffing, like someone tasting a bad egg.\n",
        "411": "\u201cI don\u2019t know about treasure,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll stake my wig there\u2019s\nfever here.\u201d\nIf the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat, it became truly\nthreatening when they had come aboard. They lay about the deck growling\ntogether in talk. The slightest order was received with a black look and\n",
        "412": "grudgingly and carelessly obeyed. Even the honest hands must have caught\nthe infection, for there was not one man aboard to mend another. Mutiny,\nit was plain, hung over us like a thunder-cloud.\n",
        "413": "And it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger. Long\nJohn was hard at work going from group to group, spending himself in\ngood advice, and as for example no man could have shown a better. He\nfairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility; he was all\nsmiles to everyone. If an order were given, John would be on his crutch\n",
        "414": "in an instant, with the cheeriest \u201cAye, aye, sir!\u201d in the world; and\nwhen there was nothing else to do, he kept up one song after another, as\nif to conceal the discontent of the rest.\nOf all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon, this obvious\nanxiety on the part of Long John appeared the worst.\n",
        "415": "We held a council in the cabin.\n\u201cSir,\u201d said the captain, \u201cif I risk another order, the whole ship\u2019ll\ncome about our ears by the run. You see, sir, here it is. I get a rough\nanswer, do I not? Well, if I speak back, pikes will be going in two\n",

        "418": "defend the right. If some go, you mark my words, sir, Silver\u2019ll bring\n\u2019em aboard again as mild as lambs.\u201d\nIt was so decided; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men;\nHunter, Joyce, and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received\nthe news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for,\nand then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew.\n",
        "419": "\u201cMy lads,\u201d said he, \u201cwe\u2019ve had a hot day and are all tired and out of\nsorts. A turn ashore\u2019ll hurt nobody--the boats are still in the water;\nyou can take the gigs, and as many as please may go ashore for the\nafternoon. I\u2019ll fire a gun half an hour before sundown.\u201d\nI believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their\nshins over treasure as soon as they were landed, for they all came out\nof their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a\nfaraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the\nanchorage.\n",
        "420": "The captain was too bright to be in the way. He whipped out of sight\nin a moment, leaving Silver to arrange the party, and I fancy it was as\nwell he did so. Had he been on deck, he could no longer so much as\nhave pretended not to understand the situation. It was as plain as day.\n",
        "421": "Silver was the captain, and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it. The\nhonest hands--and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on\nboard--must have been very stupid fellows. Or rather, I suppose the\ntruth was this, that all hands were disaffected by the example of the\nringleaders--only some more, some less; and a few, being good fellows in\nthe main, could neither be led nor driven any further. It is one thing\n",
        "422": "to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a\nnumber of innocent men.\nAt last, however, the party was made up. Six fellows were to stay on\nboard, and the remaining thirteen, including Silver, began to embark.\n",

If six men were left by\nSilver, it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship; and\nsince only six were left, it was equally plain that the cabin party\nhad no present need of my assistance.

        "425": "over and called out to know if that were me; and from that moment I\nbegan to regret what I had done.\nThe crews raced for the beach, but the boat I was in, having some start\nand being at once the lighter and the better manned, shot far ahead of\nher consort, and the bow had struck among the shore-side trees and I\nhad caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest\nthicket while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind.\n\u201cJim, Jim!\u201d I heard him shouting.\n",
        "426": "But you may suppose I paid no heed; jumping, ducking, and breaking\nthrough, I ran straight before my nose till I could run no longer.\n14\nThe First Blow\nI WAS so pleased at having given the slip to Long John that I began to\nenjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land\nthat I was in.\nI had crossed a marshy tract full of willows, bulrushes, and odd,\noutlandish, swampy trees; and I had now come out upon the skirts of an\nopen piece of undulating, sandy country, about a mile long, dotted with\na few pines and a great number of contorted trees, not unlike the oak\nin growth, but pale in the foliage, like willows. On the far side of\n",
        "427": "the open stood one of the hills, with two quaint, craggy peaks shining\nvividly in the sun.\nI now felt for the first time the joy of exploration. The isle was\nuninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and nothing lived in front\nof me but dumb brutes and fowls. I turned hither and thither among the\n",
        "428": "trees. Here and there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and\nthere I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and\nhissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top. Little did\nI suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous\nrattle.\n",
        "429": "Then I came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees--live, or\nevergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards they should be called--which grew\nlow along the sand like brambles, the boughs curiously twisted, the\nfoliage compact, like thatch. The thicket stretched down from the top of\none of the sandy knolls, spreading and growing taller as it went, until\nit reached the margin of the broad, reedy fen, through which the nearest\nof the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage. The marsh was\nsteaming in the strong sun, and the outline of the Spy-glass trembled\nthrough the haze.\n",
        "430": "All at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes;\na wild duck flew up with a quack, another followed, and soon over the\nwhole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and\ncircling in the air. I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be\ndrawing near along the borders of the fen. Nor was I deceived, for soon\nI heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice, which, as I\ncontinued to give ear, grew steadily louder and nearer.\n",
        "431": "This put me in a great fear, and I crawled under cover of the nearest\nlive-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a mouse.\nAnother voice answered, and then the first voice, which I now recognized\nto be Silver\u2019s, once more took up the story and ran on for a long while\nin a stream, only now and again interrupted by the other. By the sound\nthey must have been talking earnestly, and almost fiercely; but no\ndistinct word came to my hearing.\n",
        "432": "At last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down,\nfor not only did they cease to draw any nearer, but the birds themselves\nbegan to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the\nswamp.\nAnd now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business, that since\nI had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the\nleast I could do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my\nplain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage, under the\nfavourable ambush of the crouching trees.\nI could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly, not only by\nthe sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that\nstill hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders.\n",
        "433": "Crawling on all fours, I made steadily but slowly towards them, till at\nlast, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, I could see clear\ndown into a little green dell beside the marsh, and closely set about\nwith trees, where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to\nface in conversation.\nThe sun beat full upon them. Silver had thrown his hat beside him on the\nground, and his great, smooth, blond face, all shining with heat, was\nlifted to the other man\u2019s in a kind of appeal.\n",
        "434": "\u201cMate,\u201d he was saying, \u201cit\u2019s because I thinks gold dust of you--gold\ndust, and you may lay to that!

        "505": "I found them all shaken, as was natural. The squire was sitting down, as\nwhite as a sheet, thinking of the harm he had led us to, the good soul!\nAnd one of the six forecastle hands was little better.\n",
        "506": "\u201cThere\u2019s a man,\u201d says Captain Smollett, nodding towards him, \u201cnew to\nthis work. He came nigh-hand fainting, doctor, when he heard the cry.\nAnother touch of the rudder and that man would join us.\u201d\nI told my plan to the captain, and between us we settled on the details\nof its accomplishment.\n",
        "507": "We put old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle,\nwith three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection. Hunter\nbrought the boat round under the stern-port, and Joyce and I set to work\nloading her with powder tins, muskets, bags of biscuits, kegs of pork, a\ncask of cognac, and my invaluable medicine chest.\nIn the meantime, the squire and the captain stayed on deck, and the\nlatter hailed the coxswain, who was the principal man aboard.\n",

        "510": "By this time, tumbling things in as they came, we had the jolly-boat\nloaded as much as we dared. Joyce and I got out through the stern-port,\nand we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us.\nThis second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore. \u201cLillibullero\u201d\n",

I had half a\nmind to change my plan and destroy their boats, but I feared that Silver\nand the others might be close at hand, and all might very well be lost\nby trying for too much.\nWe had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to\nprovision the block house. All three made the first journey, heavily\n",

Then, leaving Joyce to\nguard them--one man, to be sure, but with half a dozen muskets--Hunter\nand I returned to the jolly-boat and loaded ourselves once more. So\nwe proceeded without pausing to take breath, till the whole cargo was\nbestowed, when the two servants took up their position in the block\nhouse, and I, with all my power, sculled back to the HISPANIOLA.\n",
        "513": "That we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it\nreally was. They had the advantage of numbers, of course, but we had the\nadvantage of arms. Not one of the men ashore had a musket, and before\nthey could get within range for pistol shooting, we flattered ourselves\nwe should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least.\n",
        "514": "The squire was waiting for me at the stern window, all his faintness\ngone from him. He caught the painter and made it fast, and we fell to\nloading the boat for our very lives. Pork, powder, and biscuit was the\ncargo, with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me\nand Redruth and the captain. The rest of the arms and powder we dropped\n",

Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the\ndirection of the two gigs; and though this reassured us for Joyce and\nHunter, who were well to the eastward, it warned our party to be off.\n",
        "516": "Redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the\nboat, which we then brought round to the ship\u2019s counter, to be handier\nfor Captain Smollett.\n\u201cNow, men,\u201d said he, \u201cdo you hear me?\u201d\nThere was no answer from the forecastle.\n",

        "520": "There was a sudden scuffle, a sound of blows, and out burst Abraham\nGray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek, and came running to the\ncaptain like a dog to the whistle.\n\u201cI\u2019m with you, sir,\u201d said he.\nAnd the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us, and we\nhad shoved off and given way.\n",

        "522": "the captain--over six feet high, was already more than she was meant\nto carry. Add to that the powder, pork, and bread-bags. The gunwale was\nlipping astern. Several times we shipped a little water, and my breeches\nand the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a\nhundred yards.\n",
        "523": "The captain made us trim the boat, and we got her to lie a little more\nevenly. All the same, we were afraid to breathe.\nIn the second place, the ebb was now making--a strong rippling current\nrunning westward through the basin, and then south\u2019ard and seaward down\nthe straits by which we had entered in the morning. Even the ripples\nwere a danger to our overloaded craft, but the worst of it was that we\nwere swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place\nbehind the point. If we let the current have its way we should come\n",
        "524": "ashore beside the gigs, where the pirates might appear at any moment.\n\u201cI cannot keep her head for the stockade, sir,\u201d said I to the captain.\nI was steering, while he and Redruth, two fresh men, were at the oars.\n",
        "525": "\u201cThe tide keeps washing her down. Could you pull a little stronger?\u201d\n\u201cNot without swamping the boat,\u201d said he. \u201cYou must bear up, sir, if you\nplease--bear up until you see you\u2019re gaining.\u201d\n",
        "526": "I tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward\nuntil I had laid her head due east, or just about right angles to the\nway we ought to go.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never get ashore at this rate,\u201d said I.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s the only course that we can lie, sir, we must even lie it,\u201d\n returned the captain. \u201cWe must keep upstream. You see, sir,\u201d he went on,\n",
        "527": "\u201cif once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place, it\u2019s hard to say\nwhere we should get ashore, besides the chance of being boarded by the\ngigs; whereas, the way we go the current must slacken, and then we can\ndodge back along the shore.\u201d\n\u201cThe current\u2019s less a\u2019ready, sir,\u201d said the man Gray, who was sitting in\nthe fore-sheets; \u201cyou can ease her off a bit.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, my man,\u201d said I, quite as if nothing had happened, for we\nhad all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves.\n",
        "528": "Suddenly the captain spoke up again, and I thought his voice was a\nlittle changed.\n\u201cThe gun!\u201d said he.\n\u201cI have thought of that,\u201d said I, for I made sure he was thinking of a\nbombardment of the fort. \u201cThey could never get the gun ashore, and if\n",
        "529": "they did, they could never haul it through the woods.\u201d\n\u201cLook astern, doctor,\u201d replied the captain.\nWe had entirely forgotten the long nine; and there, to our horror, were\nthe five rogues busy about her, getting off her jacket, as they called\nthe stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed. Not only that, but\n",
        "530": "it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the\npowder for the gun had been left behind, and a stroke with an axe would\nput it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad.\n\u201cIsrael was Flint\u2019s gunner,\u201d said Gray hoarsely.\nAt any risk, we put the boat\u2019s head direct for the landing-place. By\n",
        "531": "this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept\nsteerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing, and I could\nkeep her steady for the goal. But the worst of it was that with the\ncourse I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the\nHISPANIOLA and offered a target like a barn door.\nI could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands\nplumping down a round-shot on the deck.\n",
        "532": "\u201cWho\u2019s the best shot?\u201d asked the captain.\n\u201cMr. Trelawney, out and away,\u201d said I.\n\u201cMr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of these men, sir?\n",
        "533": "Hands, if possible,\u201d said the captain.\nTrelawney was as cool as steel. He looked to the priming of his gun.\n\u201cNow,\u201d cried the captain, \u201ceasy with that gun, sir, or you\u2019ll swamp the\nboat. All hands stand by to trim her when he aims.\u201d\n",
        "534": "The squire raised his gun, the rowing ceased, and we leaned over to the\nother side to keep the balance, and all was so nicely contrived that we\ndid not ship a drop.\nThey had the gun, by this time, slewed round upon the swivel, and Hands,\nwho was at the muzzle with the rammer, was in consequence the most\nexposed. However, we had no luck, for just as Trelawney fired, down he\nstooped, the ball whistled over him, and it was one of the other four\nwho fell.\n",
        "535": "The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a\ngreat number of voices from the shore, and looking in that direction\nI saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling\ninto their places in the boats.\n\u201cHere come the gigs, sir,\u201d said I.\n\u201cGive way, then,\u201d cried the captain. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t mind if we swamp her\n",
        "536": "now. If we can\u2019t get ashore, all\u2019s up.\u201d\n\u201cOnly one of the gigs is being manned, sir,\u201d I added; \u201cthe crew of the\nother most likely going round by shore to cut us off.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have a hot run, sir,\u201d returned the captain. \u201cJack ashore, you\n",
        "537": "know. It\u2019s not them I mind; it\u2019s the round-shot. Carpet bowls! My lady\u2019s\nmaid couldn\u2019t miss. Tell us, squire, when you see the match, and we\u2019ll\nhold water.\u201d\n",
        "538": "In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so\noverloaded, and we had shipped but little water in the process. We were\nnow close in; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her, for the\nebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering\ntrees. The gig was no longer to be feared; the little point had already\nconcealed it from our eyes. The ebb-tide, which had so cruelly delayed\n",
        "539": "us, was now making reparation and delaying our assailants. The one\nsource of danger was the gun.\n\u201cIf I durst,\u201d said the captain, \u201cI\u2019d stop and pick off another man.\u201d\n",
        "540": "But it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot. They\nhad never so much as looked at their fallen comrade, though he was not\ndead, and I could see him trying to crawl away.\n\u201cReady!\u201d cried the squire.\n",
        "541": "\u201cHold!\u201d cried the captain, quick as an echo.\nAnd he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily\nunder water. The report fell in at the same instant of time. This was\nthe first that Jim heard, the sound of the squire\u2019s shot not having\nreached him. Where the ball passed, not one of us precisely knew, but I\n",
        "542": "fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have\ncontributed to our disaster.\nAt any rate, the boat sank by the stern, quite gently, in three feet of\nwater, leaving the captain and myself, facing each other, on our feet.\nThe other three took complete headers, and came up again drenched and\nbubbling.\n",
        "543": "So far there was no great harm. No lives were lost, and we could wade\nashore in safety. But there were all our stores at the bottom, and to\nmake things worse, only two guns out of five remained in a state for\nservice. Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over my head, by\n",
        "544": "a sort of instinct. As for the captain, he had carried his over his\nshoulder by a bandoleer, and like a wise man, lock uppermost. The other\nthree had gone down with the boat.\n",
        "545": "To add to our concern, we heard voices already drawing near us in the\nwoods along shore, and we had not only the danger of being cut off from\nthe stockade in our half-crippled state but the fear before us whether,\nif Hunter and Joyce were attacked by half a dozen, they would have the\nsense and conduct to stand firm. Hunter was steady, that we knew; Joyce\nwas a doubtful case--a pleasant, polite man for a valet and to brush\none\u2019s clothes, but not entirely fitted for a man of war.\nWith all this in our minds, we waded ashore as fast as we could, leaving\nbehind us the poor jolly-boat and a good half of all our powder and\nprovisions.\n",
        "546": "18\nNarrative Continued by the Doctor: End of the First Day\u2019s Fighting\nWE made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from\nthe stockade, and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers\nrang nearer. Soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the\ncracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket.\nI began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my\npriming.\n",
        "547": "\u201cCaptain,\u201d said I, \u201cTrelawney is the dead shot. Give him your gun; his\nown is useless.\u201d\nThey exchanged guns, and Trelawney, silent and cool as he had been since\nthe beginning of the bustle, hung a moment on his heel to see that all\nwas fit for service. At the same time, observing Gray to be unarmed, I\n",
        "548": "handed him my cutlass. It did all our hearts good to see him spit in his\nhand, knit his brows, and make the blade sing through the air. It was\nplain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt.\n",
        "549": "Forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade\nin front of us. We struck the enclosure about the middle of the south\nside, and almost at the same time, seven mutineers--Job Anderson, the\nboatswain, at their head--appeared in full cry at the southwestern\ncorner.\nThey paused as if taken aback, and before they recovered, not only the\nsquire and I, but Hunter and Joyce from the block house, had time to\nfire. The four shots came in rather a scattering volley, but they did\n",
        "550": "the business: one of the enemy actually fell, and the rest, without\nhesitation, turned and plunged into the trees.\nAfter reloading, we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to\nthe fallen enemy. He was stone dead--shot through the heart.\nWe began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a\npistol cracked in the bush, a ball whistled close past my ear, and poor\nTom Redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground. Both the squire\n",
        "551": "and I returned the shot, but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable\nwe only wasted powder. Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor\nTom.\nThe captain and Gray were already examining him, and I saw with half an\neye that all was over.\n",
        "552": "I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers\nonce more, for we were suffered without further molestation to get the\npoor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried, groaning and\nbleeding, into the log-house.\nPoor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise, complaint,\nfear, or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till\nnow, when we had laid him down in the log-house to die. He had lain like\na Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery; he had followed every order\nsilently, doggedly, and well; he was the oldest of our party by a score\nof years; and now, sullen, old, serviceable servant, it was he that was\nto die.\n",
        "553": "The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand,\ncrying like a child.\n\u201cBe I going, doctor?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cTom, my man,\u201d said I, \u201cyou\u2019re going home.\u201d\n",
        "554": "\u201cI wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cTom,\u201d said the squire, \u201csay you forgive me, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cWould that be respectful like, from me to you, squire?\u201d was the answer.\n",
        "555": "\u201cHowsoever, so be it, amen!\u201d\nAfter a little while of silence, he said he thought somebody might read\na prayer. \u201cIt\u2019s the custom, sir,\u201d he added apologetically. And not long\nafter, without another word, he passed away.\n",
        "556": "In the meantime the captain, whom I had observed to be wonderfully\nswollen about the chest and pockets, had turned out a great many various\nstores--the British colours, a Bible, a coil of stoutish rope, pen, ink,\nthe log-book, and pounds of tobacco. He had found a longish fir-tree\nlying felled and trimmed in the enclosure, and with the help of Hunter\nhe had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed\nand made an angle. Then, climbing on the roof, he had with his own hand\nbent and run up the colours.\n",
        "557": "This seemed mightily to relieve him. He re-entered the log-house and set\nabout counting up the stores as if nothing else existed. But he had an\neye on Tom\u2019s passage for all that, and as soon as all was over, came\nforward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body.\n",
        "558": "\u201cDon\u2019t you take on, sir,\u201d he said, shaking the squire\u2019s hand. \u201cAll\u2019s\nwell with him; no fear for a hand that\u2019s been shot down in his duty to\ncaptain and owner. It mayn\u2019t be good divinity, but it\u2019s a fact.\u201d\nThen he pulled me aside.\n",
        "559": "\u201cDr. Livesey,\u201d he said, \u201cin how many weeks do you and squire expect the\nconsort?\u201d\nI told him it was a question not of weeks but of months, that if we\nwere not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us, but\nneither sooner nor later. \u201cYou can calculate for yourself,\u201d I said.\n",
        "560": "\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d returned the captain, scratching his head; \u201cand making a\nlarge allowance, sir, for all the gifts of Providence, I should say we\nwere pretty close hauled.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pity, sir, we lost that second load. That\u2019s what I mean,\u201d\n",
        "561": " replied the captain. \u201cAs for powder and shot, we\u2019ll do. But the rations\nare short, very short--so short, Dr. Livesey, that we\u2019re perhaps as well\nwithout that extra mouth.\u201d\n",
        "562": "And he pointed to the dead body under the flag.\nJust then, with a roar and a whistle, a round-shot passed high above the\nroof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood.\n\u201cOho!\u201d said the captain. \u201cBlaze away! You\u2019ve little enough powder\n",
        "563": "already, my lads.\u201d\nAt the second trial, the aim was better, and the ball descended inside\nthe stockade, scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage.\n\u201cCaptain,\u201d said the squire, \u201cthe house is quite invisible from the ship.\n",
        "564": "It must be the flag they are aiming at. Would it not be wiser to take it\nin?\u201d\n\u201cStrike my colours!\u201d cried the captain. \u201cNo, sir, not I\u201d; and as soon\n",
        "565": "as he had said the words, I think we all agreed with him. For it was\nnot only a piece of stout, seamanly, good feeling; it was good policy\nbesides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade.\nAll through the evening they kept thundering away. Ball after ball flew\n",
        "566": "over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure, but they had\nto fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft\nsand.

But towards the end of the bombardment, though still I durst\nnot venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls fell\noftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my heart again, and\nafter a long detour to the east, crept down among the shore-side trees.\nThe sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the\nwoods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage; the tide, too, was\nfar out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after the heat\nof the day, chilled me through my jacket.\n",
        "583": "The HISPANIOLA still lay where she had anchored; but, sure enough, there\nwas the Jolly Roger--the black flag of piracy--flying from her peak.\nEven as I looked, there came another red flash and another report that\nsent the echoes clattering, and one more round-shot whistled through the\nair. It was the last of the cannonade.\nI lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack. Men\n",

Away, near the mouth of the\nriver, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between that point\nand the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going, the men, whom I\nhad seen so gloomy, shouting at the oars like children. But there was a\nsound in their voices which suggested rum.\n",
        "585": "At length I thought I might return towards the stockade. I was pretty\nfar down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east,\nand is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island; and now, as I rose to my\nfeet, I saw, some distance further down the spit and rising from among\nlow bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white in\ncolour. It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben\nGunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and I\nshould know where to look for one.\n",

        "587": "stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the\nsurface of the sand. There was a porch at the door, and under this porch\nthe little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd\nkind--no other than a great ship\u2019s kettle of iron, with the bottom\nknocked out, and sunk \u201cto her bearings,\u201d as the captain said, among the\nsand.\nLittle had been left besides the framework of the house, but in one\ncorner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old\nrusty iron basket to contain the fire.\n",
        "588": "The slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been\ncleared of timber to build the house, and we could see by the stumps\nwhat a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed. Most of the soil had\nbeen washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees; only\nwhere the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and\nsome ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand.\nVery close around the stockade--too close for defence, they said--the\nwood still flourished high and dense, all of fir on the land side, but\ntowards the sea with a large admixture of live-oaks.\n",
        "589": "The cold evening breeze, of which I have spoken, whistled through every\nchink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain\nof fine sand. There was sand in our eyes, sand in our teeth, sand in our\nsuppers, sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle, for all\nthe world like porridge beginning to boil. Our chimney was a square hole\nin the roof; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way\nout, and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping\nthe eye.\n",

        "640": "And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off, ploughed down the sand, was\nhelped across the stockade, after four or five failures, by the man with\nthe flag of truce, and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the\ntrees.\n21\nThe Attack\nAS soon as Silver disappeared, the captain, who had been closely\nwatching him, turned towards the interior of the house and found not a\nman of us at his post but Gray. It was the first time we had ever seen\nhim angry.\n",
        "641": "\u201cQuarters!\u201d he roared. And then, as we all slunk back to our places,\n\u201cGray,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll put your name in the log; you\u2019ve stood by your\nduty like a seaman. Mr. Trelawney, I\u2019m surprised at you, sir. Doctor,\nI thought you had worn the king\u2019s coat! If that was how you served at\n",
        "642": "Fontenoy, sir, you\u2019d have been better in your berth.\u201d\nThe doctor\u2019s watch were all back at their loopholes, the rest were busy\nloading the spare muskets, and everyone with a red face, you may be\ncertain, and a flea in his ear, as the saying is.\nThe captain looked on for a while in silence. Then he spoke.\n",
        "643": "\u201cMy lads,\u201d said he, \u201cI\u2019ve given Silver a broadside. I pitched it in\nred-hot on purpose; and before the hour\u2019s out, as he said, we shall be\nboarded. We\u2019re outnumbered, I needn\u2019t tell you that, but we fight in\nshelter; and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline.\n",
        "644": "I\u2019ve no manner of doubt that we can drub them, if you choose.\u201d\nThen he went the rounds and saw, as he said, that all was clear.\nOn the two short sides of the house, east and west, there were only two\nloopholes; on the south side where the porch was, two again; and on the\nnorth side, five. There was a round score of muskets for the seven\n",
        "645": "of us; the firewood had been built into four piles--tables, you might\nsay--one about the middle of each side, and on each of these tables some\nammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the\ndefenders. In the middle, the cutlasses lay ranged.\n\u201cToss out the fire,\u201d said the captain; \u201cthe chill is past, and we\nmustn\u2019t have smoke in our eyes.\u201d\nThe iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney, and the\n",
        "646": "embers smothered among sand.\n\u201cHawkins hasn\u2019t had his breakfast. Hawkins, help yourself, and back to\nyour post to eat it,\u201d continued Captain Smollett. \u201cLively, now, my lad;\n",
        "647": "you\u2019ll want it before you\u2019ve done. Hunter, serve out a round of brandy\nto all hands.\u201d\nAnd while this was going on, the captain completed, in his own mind, the\nplan of the defence.\n",
        "648": "\u201cDoctor, you will take the door,\u201d he resumed. \u201cSee, and don\u2019t expose\nyourself; keep within, and fire through the porch. Hunter, take the east\nside, there. Joyce, you stand by the west, my man. Mr. Trelawney, you\n",
        "649": "are the best shot--you and Gray will take this long north side, with the\nfive loopholes; it\u2019s there the danger is. If they can get up to it and\nfire in upon us through our own ports, things would begin to look dirty.\nHawkins, neither you nor I are much account at the shooting; we\u2019ll stand\nby to load and bear a hand.\u201d\n",
        "650": "As the captain had said, the chill was past. As soon as the sun had\nclimbed above our girdle of trees, it fell with all its force upon the\nclearing and drank up the vapours at a draught. Soon the sand was baking\nand the resin melting in the logs of the block house. Jackets and coats\n",
        "651": "were flung aside, shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the\nshoulders; and we stood there, each at his post, in a fever of heat and\nanxiety.\nAn hour passed away.\n\u201cHang them!\u201d said the captain. \u201cThis is as dull as the doldrums. Gray,\n",
        "652": "whistle for a wind.\u201d\nAnd just at that moment came the first news of the attack.\n\u201cIf you please, sir,\u201d said Joyce, \u201cif I see anyone, am I to fire?\u201d\n",
        "653": "\u201cI told you so!\u201d cried the captain.\n\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d returned Joyce with the same quiet civility.\nNothing followed for a time, but the remark had set us all on the alert,\nstraining ears and eyes--the musketeers with their pieces balanced in\ntheir hands, the captain out in the middle of the block house with his\nmouth very tight and a frown on his face.\n",
        "654": "So some seconds passed, till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket\nand fired. The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and\nrepeated from without in a scattering volley, shot behind shot, like\na string of geese, from every side of the enclosure. Several bullets\nstruck the log-house, but not one entered; and as the smoke cleared away\nand vanished, the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and\nempty as before. Not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel\n",
        "655": "betrayed the presence of our foes.\n\u201cDid you hit your man?\u201d asked the captain.\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d replied Joyce. \u201cI believe not, sir.\u201d\n",
        "656": "\u201cNext best thing to tell the truth,\u201d muttered Captain Smollett. \u201cLoad\nhis gun, Hawkins. How many should say there were on your side, doctor?\u201d\n\u201cI know precisely,\u201d said Dr. Livesey. \u201cThree shots were fired on this\n",
        "657": "side. I saw the three flashes--two close together--one farther to the\nwest.\u201d\n\u201cThree!\u201d repeated the captain. \u201cAnd how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?\u201d\n",
        "658": "But this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the\nnorth--seven by the squire\u2019s computation, eight or nine according to\nGray. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired. It was\nplain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and\nthat on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of\nhostilities. But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements. If\n",
        "659": "the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would\ntake possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats\nin our own stronghold.\nNor had we much time left to us for thought. Suddenly, with a loud\nhuzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side\nand ran straight on the stockade. At the same moment, the fire was once\n",
        "660": "more opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang through the doorway\nand knocked the doctor\u2019s musket into bits.\nThe boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys. Squire and Gray fired\nagain and yet again; three men fell, one forwards into the enclosure,\ntwo back on the outside. But of these, one was evidently more frightened\n",
        "661": "than hurt, for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly\ndisappeared among the trees.\nTwo had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good their footing\ninside our defences, while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight\nmen, each evidently supplied with several muskets, kept up a hot though\nuseless fire on the log-house.\nThe four who had boarded made straight before them for the building,\nshouting as they ran, and the men among the trees shouted back to\nencourage them. Several shots were fired, but such was the hurry of the\n",
        "662": "marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect. In a moment, the\nfour pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us.\nThe head of Job Anderson, the boatswain, appeared at the middle\nloophole.\n",
        "663": "\u201cAt \u2019em, all hands--all hands!\u201d he roared in a voice of thunder.\nAt the same moment, another pirate grasped Hunter\u2019s musket by the\nmuzzle, wrenched it from his hands, plucked it through the loophole,\nand with one stunning blow, laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor.\nMeanwhile a third, running unharmed all around the house, appeared\nsuddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor.\n",
        "664": "Our position was utterly reversed. A moment since we were firing, under\ncover, at an exposed enemy; now it was we who lay uncovered and could\nnot return a blow.\nThe log-house was full of smoke, to which we owed our comparative\nsafety. Cries and confusion, the flashes and reports of pistol-shots,\n",
        "665": "and one loud groan rang in my ears.\n\u201cOut, lads, out, and fight \u2019em in the open! Cutlasses!\u201d cried the\ncaptain.\n",
        "666": "I snatched a cutlass from the pile, and someone, at the same time\nsnatching another, gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly\nfelt. I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight. Someone was\nclose behind, I knew not whom. Right in front, the doctor was pursuing\nhis assailant down the hill, and just as my eyes fell upon him, beat\ndown his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash\nacross the face.\n",
        "667": "\u201cRound the house, lads! Round the house!\u201d cried the captain; and even in\nthe hurly-burly, I perceived a change in his voice.\nMechanically, I obeyed, turned eastwards, and with my cutlass raised,\nran round the corner of the house. Next moment I was face to face\n",
        "668": "with Anderson. He roared aloud, and his hanger went up above his head,\nflashing in the sunlight. I had not time to be afraid, but as the blow\nstill hung impending, leaped in a trice upon one side, and missing my\nfoot in the soft sand, rolled headlong down the slope.\n",
        "669": "When I had first sallied from the door, the other mutineers had been\nalready swarming up the palisade to make an end of us. One man, in a red\nnight-cap, with his cutlass in his mouth, had even got upon the top and\nthrown a leg across. Well, so short had been the interval that when I\nfound my feet again all was in the same posture, the fellow with the red\nnight-cap still half-way over, another still just showing his head above\nthe top of the stockade. And yet, in this breath of time, the fight was\n",
        "670": "over and the victory was ours.\nGray, following close behind me, had cut down the big boatswain ere\nhe had time to recover from his last blow. Another had been shot at a\nloophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony,\nthe pistol still smoking in his hand. A third, as I had seen, the doctor\n",
        "671": "had disposed of at a blow. Of the four who had scaled the palisade, one\nonly remained unaccounted for, and he, having left his cutlass on the\nfield, was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him.\n\u201cFire--fire from the house!\u201d cried the doctor. \u201cAnd you, lads, back into\n",

        "673": "The doctor and Gray and I ran full speed for shelter. The survivors\nwould soon be back where they had left their muskets, and at any moment\nthe fire might recommence.\nThe house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke, and we saw at\na glance the price we had paid for victory.

        "677": "this was, of course, not known till after by the faithful party.\nPART FIVE--My Sea Adventure\n22\nHow My Sea Adventure Began\nTHERE was no return of the mutineers--not so much as another shot out of\nthe woods. They had \u201cgot their rations for that day,\u201d as the captain put\nit, and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the\nwounded and get dinner. Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the\n",
        "678": "danger, and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at, for\nhorror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor\u2019s patients.\nOut of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only three still\nbreathed--that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole,\nHunter, and Captain Smollett; and of these, the first two were as good\nas dead; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor\u2019s knife, and Hunter,\ndo what we could, never recovered consciousness in this world. He\nlingered all day, breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his\napoplectic fit, but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the\nblow and his skull fractured in falling, and some time in the following\nnight, without sign or sound, he went to his Maker.\n",
        "679": "As for the captain, his wounds were grievous indeed, but not dangerous.\nNo organ was fatally injured. Anderson\u2019s ball--for it was Job that\nshot him first--had broken his shoulder-blade and touched the lung, not\nbadly; the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf.\n",
        "680": "He was sure to recover, the doctor said, but in the meantime, and for\nweeks to come, he must not walk nor move his arm, nor so much as speak\nwhen he could help it.\nMy own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea-bite. Doctor\nLivesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the\nbargain.\n",
        "681": "After dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain\u2019s side awhile\nin consultation; and when they had talked to their hearts\u2019 content, it\nbeing then a little past noon, the doctor took up his hat and pistols,\ngirt on a cutlass, put the chart in his pocket, and with a musket over\nhis shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly\nthrough the trees.\nGray and I were sitting together at the far end of the block house, to\nbe out of earshot of our officers consulting; and Gray took his pipe out\nof his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again, so thunder-struck\nhe was at this occurrence.\n\u201cWhy, in the name of Davy Jones,\u201d said he, \u201cis Dr. Livesey mad?\u201d\n",
        "682": "\u201cWhy no,\u201d says I. \u201cHe\u2019s about the last of this crew for that, I take\nit.\u201d\n\u201cWell, shipmate,\u201d said Gray, \u201cmad he may not be; but if HE\u2019S not, you\nmark my words, I am.\u201d\n",
        "683": "\u201cI take it,\u201d replied I, \u201cthe doctor has his idea; and if I am right,\nhe\u2019s going now to see Ben Gunn.\u201d\nI was right, as appeared later; but in the meantime, the house being\nstifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze\nwith midday sun, I began to get another thought into my head, which was\nnot by any means so right. What I began to do was to envy the doctor\nwalking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the\npleasant smell of the pines, while I sat grilling, with my clothes\nstuck to the hot resin, and so much blood about me and so many poor\ndead bodies lying all around that I took a disgust of the place that was\nalmost as strong as fear.\n",
        "684": "All the time I was washing out the block house, and then washing up\nthe things from dinner, this disgust and envy kept growing stronger\nand stronger, till at last, being near a bread-bag, and no one then\nobserving me, I took the first step towards my escapade and filled both\npockets of my coat with biscuit.\nI was a fool, if you like, and certainly I was going to do a foolish,\nover-bold act; but I was determined to do it with all the precautions in\nmy power. These biscuits, should anything befall me, would keep me, at\nleast, from starving till far on in the next day.\n",
        "685": "The next thing I laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as I already\nhad a powder-horn and bullets, I felt myself well supplied with arms.\nAs for the scheme I had in my head, it was not a bad one in itself. I\nwas to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east\nfrom the open sea, find the white rock I had observed last evening, and\nascertain whether it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat,\na thing quite worth doing, as I still believe. But as I was certain I\n",
        "686": "should not be allowed to leave the enclosure, my only plan was to take\nFrench leave and slip out when nobody was watching, and that was so bad\na way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong. But I was only a boy,\nand I had made my mind up.\nWell, as things at last fell out, I found an admirable opportunity. The\n",
        "687": "squire and Gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages, the\ncoast was clear, I made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the\nthickest of the trees, and before my absence was observed I was out of\ncry of my companions.\nThis was my second folly, far worse than the first, as I left but two\nsound men to guard the house; but like the first, it was a help towards\nsaving all of us.\nI took my way straight for the east coast of the island, for I was\ndetermined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of\nobservation from the anchorage. It was already late in the afternoon,\n",
        "688": "although still warm and sunny. As I continued to thread the tall woods,\nI could hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder of the\nsurf, but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which\nshowed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual. Soon cool\ndraughts of air began to reach me, and a few steps farther I came forth\ninto the open borders of the grove, and saw the sea lying blue and sunny\nto the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the\nbeach.\n",
        "689": "I have never seen the sea quiet round Treasure Island. The sun might\nblaze overhead, the air be without a breath, the surface smooth and\nblue, but still these great rollers would be running along all the\nexternal coast, thundering and thundering by day and night; and I scarce\nbelieve there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of\nearshot of their noise.\nI walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment, till, thinking\nI was now got far enough to the south, I took the cover of some thick\nbushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit.\n",
        "690": "Behind me was the sea, in front the anchorage. The sea breeze, as though\nit had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence, was already\nat an end; it had been succeeded by light, variable airs from the south\nand south-east, carrying great banks of fog; and the anchorage, under\nlee of Skeleton Island, lay still and leaden as when first we entered\nit. The HISPANIOLA, in that unbroken mirror, was exactly portrayed from\nthe truck to the waterline, the Jolly Roger hanging from her peak.\n",
        "691": "Alongside lay one of the gigs, Silver in the stern-sheets--him I could\nalways recognize--while a couple of men were leaning over the stern\nbulwarks, one of them with a red cap--the very rogue that I had seen\nsome hours before stride-legs upon the palisade. Apparently they were\ntalking and laughing, though at that distance--upwards of a mile--I\ncould, of course, hear no word of what was said. All at once there began\nthe most horrid, unearthly screaming, which at first startled me badly,\nthough I had soon remembered the voice of Captain Flint and even thought\nI could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon\nher master\u2019s wrist.\n",
        "692": "Soon after, the jolly-boat shoved off and pulled for shore, and the man\nwith the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion.\nJust about the same time, the sun had gone down behind the Spy-glass,\nand as the fog was collecting rapidly, it began to grow dark in earnest.\nI saw I must lose no time if I were to find the boat that evening.\n",
        "693": "The white rock, visible enough above the brush, was still some eighth of\na mile further down the spit, and it took me a goodish while to get up\nwith it, crawling, often on all fours, among the scrub. Night had almost\ncome when I laid my hand on its rough sides. Right below it there was\nan exceedingly small hollow of green turf, hidden by banks and a thick\nunderwood about knee-deep, that grew there very plentifully; and in the\ncentre of the dell, sure enough, a little tent of goat-skins, like what\nthe gipsies carry about with them in England.\n",
        "694": "I dropped into the hollow, lifted the side of the tent, and there was\nBen Gunn\u2019s boat--home-made if ever anything was home-made; a rude,\nlop-sided framework of tough wood, and stretched upon that a covering of\ngoat-skin, with the hair inside. The thing was extremely small, even\nfor me, and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a\nfull-sized man. There was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of\nstretcher in the bows, and a double paddle for propulsion.\n",
        "695": "I had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons made, but\nI have seen one since, and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunn\u2019s\nboat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever\nmade by man. But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly\npossessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable.\nWell, now that I had found the boat, you would have thought I had had\nenough of truantry for once, but in the meantime I had taken another\nnotion and become so obstinately fond of it that I would have carried\nit out, I believe, in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself. This was\n",
        "696": "to slip out under cover of the night, cut the HISPANIOLA adrift, and let\nher go ashore where she fancied. I had quite made up my mind that the\nmutineers, after their repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their\nhearts than to up anchor and away to sea; this, I thought, it would be\na fine thing to prevent, and now that I had seen how they left their\nwatchmen unprovided with a boat, I thought it might be done with little\nrisk.\nDown I sat to wait for darkness, and made a hearty meal of biscuit. It\n",
        "697": "was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose. The fog had now buried\nall heaven. As the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared,\nabsolute blackness settled down on Treasure Island. And when, at last,\n",
        "698": "I shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow\nwhere I had supped, there were but two points visible on the whole\nanchorage.\nOne was the great fire on shore, by which the defeated pirates lay\ncarousing in the swamp. The other, a mere blur of light upon the\ndarkness, indicated the position of the anchored ship. She had swung\n",
        "699": "round to the ebb--her bow was now towards me--the only lights on board\nwere in the cabin, and what I saw was merely a reflection on the fog of\nthe strong rays that flowed from the stern window.\nThe ebb had already run some time, and I had to wade through a long belt\nof swampy sand, where I sank several times above the ankle, before I\ncame to the edge of the retreating water, and wading a little way in,\nwith some strength and dexterity, set my coracle, keel downwards, on the\nsurface.\n23\nThe Ebb-tide Runs\nTHE coracle--as I had ample reason to know before I was done with\nher--was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight, both\nbuoyant and clever in a seaway; but she was the most cross-grained,\nlop-sided craft to manage. Do as you pleased, she always made more\n",
        "700": "leeway than anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvre\nshe was best at. Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was \u201cqueer\nto handle till you knew her way.\u201d\nCertainly I did not know her way. She turned in every direction but the\n",
        "701": "one I was bound to go; the most part of the time we were broadside on,\nand I am very sure I never should have made the ship at all but for the\ntide. By good fortune, paddle as I pleased, the tide was still sweeping\nme down; and there lay the HISPANIOLA right in the fairway, hardly to be\nmissed.\nFirst she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than\ndarkness, then her spars and hull began to take shape, and the next\nmoment, as it seemed (for, the farther I went, the brisker grew the\ncurrent of the ebb), I was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold.\n",
        "702": "The hawser was as taut as a bowstring, and the current so strong she\npulled upon her anchor. All round the hull, in the blackness, the\nrippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream.\nOne cut with my sea-gully and the HISPANIOLA would go humming down the\ntide.\n",
        "703": "So far so good, but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut\nhawser, suddenly cut, is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse. Ten to\none, if I were so foolhardy as to cut the HISPANIOLA from her anchor, I\nand the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water.\nThis brought me to a full stop, and if fortune had not again\nparticularly favoured me, I should have had to abandon my design. But\n",
        "704": "the light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and south\nhad hauled round after nightfall into the south-west. Just while I was\nmeditating, a puff came, caught the HISPANIOLA, and forced her up into\nthe current; and to my great joy, I felt the hawser slacken in my grasp,\nand the hand by which I held it dip for a second under water.\nWith that I made my mind up, took out my gully, opened it with my teeth,\nand cut one strand after another, till the vessel swung only by two.\n",
        "705": "Then I lay quiet, waiting to sever these last when the strain should be\nonce more lightened by a breath of wind.\nAll this time I had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin, but\nto say truth, my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts\nthat I had scarcely given ear. Now, however, when I had nothing else to\ndo, I began to pay more heed.\n",
        "706": "One I recognized for the coxswain\u2019s, Israel Hands, that had been Flint\u2019s\ngunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend of the red\nnight-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still\ndrinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunken\ncry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined to\nbe an empty bottle. But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they\n",
        "707": "were furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and\nthen there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end\nin blows. But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled\nlower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passed\naway without result.\n",
        "708": "On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly\nthrough the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull, old, droning\nsailor\u2019s song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse,\nand seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer. I had\nheard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words:\n     \u201cBut one man of her crew alive,\n     What put to sea with seventy-five.\u201d\n",
        "709": "And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a\ncompany that had met such cruel losses in the morning. But, indeed, from\nwhat I saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed\non.\nAt last the breeze came; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the\ndark; I felt the hawser slacken once more, and with a good, tough\neffort, cut the last fibres through.\n",
        "710": "The breeze had but little action on the coracle, and I was almost\ninstantly swept against the bows of the HISPANIOLA. At the same time,\nthe schooner began to turn upon her heel, spinning slowly, end for end,\nacross the current.\nI wrought like a fiend, for I expected every moment to be swamped; and\nsince I found I could not push the coracle directly off, I now shoved\nstraight astern. At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour, and\n",
        "711": "just as I gave the last impulsion, my hands came across a light cord\nthat was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks. Instantly I\ngrasped it.\nWhy I should have done so I can hardly say. It was at first mere\n",
        "712": "instinct, but once I had it in my hands and found it fast, curiosity\nbegan to get the upper hand, and I determined I should have one look\nthrough the cabin window.\nI pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and when I judged myself near\nenough, rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded\nthe roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin.\nBy this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty\nswiftly through the water; indeed, we had already fetched up level with\nthe camp-fire. The ship was talking, as sailors say, loudly, treading\n",
        "713": "the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash; and until I\ngot my eye above the window-sill I could not comprehend why the watchmen\nhad taken no alarm. One glance, however, was sufficient; and it was\nonly one glance that I durst take from that unsteady skiff. It showed me\nHands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle, each with a\nhand upon the other\u2019s throat.\n",
        "714": "I dropped upon the thwart again, none too soon, for I was near\noverboard. I could see nothing for the moment but these two furious,\nencrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp, and I shut my\neyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness.\nThe endless ballad had come to an end at last, and the whole diminished\ncompany about the camp-fire had broken into the chorus I had heard so\noften:\n          \u201cFifteen men on the dead man\u2019s chest--\n              Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\n",
        "715": "           Drink and the devil had done for the rest--\n              Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\u201d\nI was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that very\nmoment in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA, when I was surprised by a sudden\nlurch of the coracle. At the same moment, she yawed sharply and seemed\nto change her course. The speed in the meantime had strangely increased.\n",
        "716": "I opened my eyes at once. All round me were little ripples, combing\nover with a sharp, bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent. The\nHISPANIOLA herself, a few yards in whose wake I was still being whirled\nalong, seemed to stagger in her course, and I saw her spars toss a\nlittle against the blackness of the night; nay, as I looked longer, I\nmade sure she also was wheeling to the southward.\n",
        "717": "I glanced over my shoulder, and my heart jumped against my ribs. There,\nright behind me, was the glow of the camp-fire. The current had turned\nat right angles, sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and\nthe little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever bubbling higher, ever\nmuttering louder, it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea.\n",
        "718": "Suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw, turning,\nperhaps, through twenty degrees; and almost at the same moment one\nshout followed another from on board; I could hear feet pounding on\nthe companion ladder and I knew that the two drunkards had at last been\ninterrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster.\nI lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutly\nrecommended my spirit to its Maker. At the end of the straits, I\nmade sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers, where all my\ntroubles would be ended speedily; and though I could, perhaps, bear to\ndie, I could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached.\n",
        "719": "So I must have lain for hours, continually beaten to and fro upon the\nbillows, now and again wetted with flying sprays, and never ceasing to\nexpect death at the next plunge. Gradually weariness grew upon me; a\nnumbness, an occasional stupor, fell upon my mind even in the midst of\nmy terrors, until sleep at last supervened and in my sea-tossed coracle\nI lay and dreamed of home and the old Admiral Benbow.\n24\nThe Cruise of the Coracle\nIT was broad day when I awoke and found myself tossing at the south-west\nend of Treasure Island. The sun was up but was still hid from me behind\n",
        "720": "the great bulk of the Spy-glass, which on this side descended almost to\nthe sea in formidable cliffs.\nHaulbowline Head and Mizzen-mast Hill were at my elbow, the hill bare\nand dark, the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high and\nfringed with great masses of fallen rock. I was scarce a quarter of a\nmile to seaward, and it was my first thought to paddle in and land.\n",
        "721": "That notion was soon given over. Among the fallen rocks the breakers\nspouted and bellowed; loud reverberations, heavy sprays flying and\nfalling, succeeded one another from second to second; and I saw myself,\nif I ventured nearer, dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending\nmy strength in vain to scale the beetling crags.\nNor was that all, for crawling together on flat tables of rock or\nletting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports I beheld huge\nslimy monsters--soft snails, as it were, of incredible bigness--two\nor three score of them together, making the rocks to echo with their\nbarkings.\n",
        "722": "I have understood since that they were sea lions, and entirely harmless.\nBut the look of them, added to the difficulty of the shore and the\nhigh running of the surf, was more than enough to disgust me of that\nlanding-place. I felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront\nsuch perils.\n",
        "723": "In the meantime I had a better chance, as I supposed, before me. North\nof Haulbowline Head, the land runs in a long way, leaving at low tide\na long stretch of yellow sand. To the north of that, again, there comes\nanother cape--Cape of the Woods, as it was marked upon the chart--buried\nin tall green pines, which descended to the margin of the sea.\n",
        "724": "I remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets northward\nalong the whole west coast of Treasure Island, and seeing from my\nposition that I was already under its influence, I preferred to leave\nHaulbowline Head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to\nland upon the kindlier-looking Cape of the Woods.\nThere was a great, smooth swell upon the sea. The wind blowing steady\nand gentle from the south, there was no contrariety between that and the\ncurrent, and the billows rose and fell unbroken.\n",
        "725": "Had it been otherwise, I must long ago have perished; but as it was,\nit is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could\nride. Often, as I still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye\nabove the gunwale, I would see a big blue summit heaving close above me;\nyet the coracle would but bounce a little, dance as if on springs, and\nsubside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird.\nI began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at\npaddling. But even a small change in the disposition of the weight will\n",
        "726": "produce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle. And I had hardly\nmoved before the boat, giving up at once her gentle dancing movement,\nran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy, and\nstruck her nose, with a spout of spray, deep into the side of the next\nwave.\nI was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my old\nposition, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led\nme as softly as before among the billows. It was plain she was not to be\n",
        "727": "interfered with, and at that rate, since I could in no way influence her\ncourse, what hope had I left of reaching land?\nI began to be horribly frightened, but I kept my head, for all that.\nFirst, moving with all care, I gradually baled out the coracle with my\nsea-cap; then, getting my eye once more above the gunwale, I set myself\nto study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers.\n",
        "728": "I found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it looks\nfrom shore or from a vessel\u2019s deck, was for all the world like any range\nof hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth places and valleys. The\ncoracle, left to herself, turning from side to side, threaded, so to\nspeak, her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes\nand higher, toppling summits of the wave.\n\u201cWell, now,\u201d thought I to myself, \u201cit is plain I must lie where I am and\nnot disturb the balance; but it is plain also that I can put the paddle\nover the side and from time to time, in smooth places, give her a shove\nor two towards land.\u201d No sooner thought upon than done. There I lay on\n",
        "729": "my elbows in the most trying attitude, and every now and again gave a\nweak stroke or two to turn her head to shore.\nIt was very tiring and slow work, yet I did visibly gain ground; and as\nwe drew near the Cape of the Woods, though I saw I must infallibly\nmiss that point, I had still made some hundred yards of easting. I was,\nindeed, close in. I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together\n",
        "730": "in the breeze, and I felt sure I should make the next promontory without\nfail.\nIt was high time, for I now began to be tortured with thirst. The glow\nof the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from the waves, the\nsea-water that fell and dried upon me, caking my very lips with salt,\ncombined to make my throat burn and my brain ache. The sight of the\n",
        "731": "trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the\ncurrent had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea\nopened out, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts.\nRight in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the HISPANIOLA\nunder sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was\nso distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad\nor sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion,\nsurprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing\nbut stare and wonder.\n",
        "732": "The HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful\nwhite canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver. When I first\nsighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course about\nnorth-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the island\non their way back to the anchorage. Presently she began to fetch more\nand more to the westward, so that I thought they had sighted me and were\ngoing about in chase. At last, however, she fell right into the wind\u2019s\n",
        "733": "eye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with her\nsails shivering.\n\u201cClumsy fellows,\u201d said I; \u201cthey must still be drunk as owls.\u201d And I\nthought how Captain Smollett would have set them skipping.\n",
        "734": "Meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another\ntack, sailed swiftly for a minute or so, and brought up once more dead\nin the wind\u2019s eye. Again and again was this repeated. To and fro, up and\ndown, north, south, east, and west, the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoops\nand dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idly\nflapping canvas. It became plain to me that nobody was steering. And if\nso, where were the men? Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her,\n",
        "735": "I thought, and perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vessel\nto her captain.\nThe current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate.\nAs for the latter\u2019s sailing, it was so wild and intermittent, and she\nhung each time so long in irons, that she certainly gained nothing, if\nshe did not even lose. If only I dared to sit up and paddle, I made\n",
        "736": "sure that I could overhaul her. The scheme had an air of adventure\nthat inspired me, and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore\ncompanion doubled my growing courage.\nUp I got, was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray, but\nthis time stuck to my purpose and set myself, with all my strength and\ncaution, to paddle after the unsteered HISPANIOLA. Once I shipped a sea\n",
        "737": "so heavy that I had to stop and bail, with my heart fluttering like\na bird, but gradually I got into the way of the thing and guided my\ncoracle among the waves, with only now and then a blow upon her bows and\na dash of foam in my face.\nI was now gaining rapidly on the schooner; I could see the brass glisten\non the tiller as it banged about, and still no soul appeared upon her\ndecks. I could not choose but suppose she was deserted. If not, the men\nwere lying drunk below, where I might batten them down, perhaps, and do\nwhat I chose with the ship.\n",
        "738": "For some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for\nme--standing still. She headed nearly due south, yawing, of course, all\nthe time. Each time she fell off, her sails partly filled, and these\nbrought her in a moment right to the wind again. I have said this was\n",
        "739": "the worst thing possible for me, for helpless as she looked in this\nsituation, with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling\nand banging on the deck, she still continued to run away from me, not\nonly with the speed of the current, but by the whole amount of her\nleeway, which was naturally great.\nBut now, at last, I had my chance. The breeze fell for some seconds,\nvery low, and the current gradually turning her, the HISPANIOLA revolved\nslowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern, with the\ncabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning\non into the day. The main-sail hung drooped like a banner. She was\n",
        "740": "stock-still but for the current.\nFor the last little while I had even lost, but now redoubling my\nefforts, I began once more to overhaul the chase.\nI was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap;\nshe filled on the port tack and was off again, stooping and skimming\nlike a swallow.\n",
        "741": "My first impulse was one of despair, but my second was towards joy.\nRound she came, till she was broadside on to me--round still till she\nhad covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the\ndistance that separated us. I could see the waves boiling white under\nher forefoot. Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the\n",
        "742": "coracle.\nAnd then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had scarce time to\nthink--scarce time to act and save myself. I was on the summit of one\n",
        "743": "swell when the schooner came stooping over the next. The bowsprit was\nover my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle under\nwater. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while my foot was lodged\n",
        "744": "between the stay and the brace; and as I still clung there panting, a\ndull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the\ncoracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA.\n25\nI Strike the Jolly Roger\nI HAD scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib\nflapped and filled upon the other tack, with a report like a gun. The\nschooner trembled to her keel under the reverse, but next moment, the\nother sails still drawing, the jib flapped back again and hung idle.\n",
        "745": "This had nearly tossed me off into the sea; and now I lost no time,\ncrawled back along the bowsprit, and tumbled head foremost on the deck.\nI was on the lee side of the forecastle, and the mainsail, which was\nstill drawing, concealed from me a certain portion of the after-deck.\nNot a soul was to be seen. The planks, which had not been swabbed since\n",
        "746": "the mutiny, bore the print of many feet, and an empty bottle, broken by\nthe neck, tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers.\nSuddenly the HISPANIOLA came right into the wind. The jibs behind me\ncracked aloud, the rudder slammed to, the whole ship gave a sickening\nheave and shudder, and at the same moment the main-boom swung inboard,\nthe sheet groaning in the blocks, and showed me the lee after-deck.\n",
        "747": "There were the two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap on his back, as stiff\nas a handspike, with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and\nhis teeth showing through his open lips; Israel Hands propped against\nthe bulwarks, his chin on his chest, his hands lying open before him on\nthe deck, his face as white, under its tan, as a tallow candle.\nFor a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse, the\nsails filling, now on one tack, now on another, and the boom swinging to\nand fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain. Now and again too\nthere would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy\nblow of the ship\u2019s bows against the swell; so much heavier weather was\nmade of it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made, lop-sided\ncoracle, now gone to the bottom of the sea.\n",
        "748": "At every jump of the schooner, red-cap slipped to and fro, but--what was\nghastly to behold--neither his attitude nor his fixed teeth-disclosing\ngrin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage. At every jump too, Hands\nappeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the\ndeck, his feet sliding ever the farther out, and the whole body canting\ntowards the stern, so that his face became, little by little, hid\nfrom me; and at last I could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed\nringlet of one whisker.\nAt the same time, I observed, around both of them, splashes of dark\nblood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each\nother in their drunken wrath.\n",
        "749": "While I was thus looking and wondering, in a calm moment, when the ship\nwas still, Israel Hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed\nhimself back to the position in which I had seen him first. The moan,\nwhich told of pain and deadly weakness, and the way in which his jaw\nhung open went right to my heart. But when I remembered the talk I had\noverheard from the apple barrel, all pity left me.\n",
        "750": "I walked aft until I reached the main-mast.\n\u201cCome aboard, Mr. Hands,\u201d I said ironically.\nHe rolled his eyes round heavily, but he was too far gone to express\nsurprise. All he could do was to utter one word, \u201cBrandy.\u201d\n",
        "751": "It occurred to me there was no time to lose, and dodging the boom as it\nonce more lurched across the deck, I slipped aft and down the companion\nstairs into the cabin.\nIt was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy. All the\nlockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart. The floor\n",
        "752": "was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after\nwading in the marshes round their camp. The bulkheads, all painted in\nclear white and beaded round with gilt, bore a pattern of dirty hands.\nDozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of\nthe ship. One of the doctor\u2019s medical books lay open on the table, half\n",
        "753": "of the leaves gutted out, I suppose, for pipelights. In the midst of all\nthis the lamp still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber.\nI went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottles\na most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away. Certainly,\n",
        "754": "since the mutiny began, not a man of them could ever have been sober.\nForaging about, I found a bottle with some brandy left, for Hands; and\nfor myself I routed out some biscuit, some pickled fruits, a great bunch\nof raisins, and a piece of cheese. With these I came on deck, put down\nmy own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain\u2019s\nreach, went forward to the water-breaker, and had a good deep drink of\nwater, and then, and not till then, gave Hands the brandy.\n",
        "755": "He must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth.\n\u201cAye,\u201d said he, \u201cby thunder, but I wanted some o\u2019 that!\u201d\nI had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat.\n",
        "756": "\u201cMuch hurt?\u201d I asked him.\nHe grunted, or rather, I might say, he barked.\n\u201cIf that doctor was aboard,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d be right enough in a couple\nof turns, but I don\u2019t have no manner of luck, you see, and that\u2019s what\u2019s\nthe matter with me. As for that swab, he\u2019s good and dead, he is,\u201d he\n",
        "757": "added, indicating the man with the red cap. \u201cHe warn\u2019t no seaman anyhow.\nAnd where mought you have come from?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cI\u2019ve come aboard to take possession of this ship,\nMr. Hands; and you\u2019ll please regard me as your captain until further\n",
        "758": "notice.\u201d\nHe looked at me sourly enough but said nothing. Some of the colour had\ncome back into his cheeks, though he still looked very sick and still\ncontinued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about.\n",
        "759": "\u201cBy the by,\u201d I continued, \u201cI can\u2019t have these colours, Mr. Hands; and by\nyour leave, I\u2019ll strike \u2019em. Better none than these.\u201d\nAnd again dodging the boom, I ran to the colour lines, handed down their\ncursed black flag, and chucked it overboard.\n",
        "760": "\u201cGod save the king!\u201d said I, waving my cap. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an end to\nCaptain Silver!\u201d\nHe watched me keenly and slyly, his chin all the while on his breast.\n",
        "761": "\u201cI reckon,\u201d he said at last, \u201cI reckon, Cap\u2019n Hawkins, you\u2019ll kind of\nwant to get ashore now. S\u2019pose we talks.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d says I, \u201cwith all my heart, Mr. Hands. Say on.\u201d And I went\nback to my meal with a good appetite.\n",
        "762": "\u201cThis man,\u201d he began, nodding feebly at the corpse \u201c--O\u2019Brien were his\nname, a rank Irelander--this man and me got the canvas on her, meaning\nfor to sail her back.

The\nshores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern\nanchorage, but the space was longer and narrower and more like, what in\ntruth it was, the estuary of a river.

Even then\n",
        "795": "I was still so much interested, waiting for the ship to touch, that I\nhad quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over\nthe starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before\nthe bows. I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a\nsudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head. Perhaps I\nhad heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye;\nperhaps it was an instinct like a cat\u2019s; but, sure enough, when I looked\nround, there was Hands, already half-way towards me, with the dirk in\nhis right hand.\n",
        "796": "We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met, but while mine\nwas the shrill cry of terror, his was a roar of fury like a charging\nbully\u2019s. At the same instant, he threw himself forward and I leapt\nsideways towards the bows. As I did so, I let go of the tiller, which\nsprang sharp to leeward, and I think this saved my life, for it struck\nHands across the chest and stopped him, for the moment, dead.\n",
        "797": "Before he could recover, I was safe out of the corner where he had me\ntrapped, with all the deck to dodge about. Just forward of the main-mast\nI stopped, drew a pistol from my pocket, took a cool aim, though he had\nalready turned and was once more coming directly after me, and drew the\ntrigger. The hammer fell, but there followed neither flash nor sound;\nthe priming was useless with sea-water. I cursed myself for my neglect.\n",
        "798": "Why had not I, long before, reprimed and reloaded my only weapons? Then\nI should not have been as now, a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher.\nWounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could move, his grizzled\nhair tumbling over his face, and his face itself as red as a red ensign\nwith his haste and fury. I had no time to try my other pistol, nor\n",
        "799": "indeed much inclination, for I was sure it would be useless. One thing I\nsaw plainly: I must not simply retreat before him, or he would speedily\nhold me boxed into the bows, as a moment since he had so nearly boxed\nme in the stern. Once so caught, and nine or ten inches of the\nblood-stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity.\n",
        "800": "I placed my palms against the main-mast, which was of a goodish bigness,\nand waited, every nerve upon the stretch.\nSeeing that I meant to dodge, he also paused; and a moment or two passed\nin feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine. It was such\na game as I had often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove,\nbut never before, you may be sure, with such a wildly beating heart as\nnow. Still, as I say, it was a boy\u2019s game, and I thought I could hold\n",

Indeed my\ncourage had begun to rise so high that I allowed myself a few darting\nthoughts on what would be the end of the affair, and while I saw\ncertainly that I could spin it out for long, I saw no hope of any\nultimate escape.\nWell, while things stood thus, suddenly the HISPANIOLA struck,\nstaggered, ground for an instant in the sand, and then, swift as a\nblow, canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle\nof forty-five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the\nscupper holes and lay, in a pool, between the deck and bulwark.\n",
        "802": "We were both of us capsized in a second, and both of us rolled, almost\ntogether, into the scuppers, the dead red-cap, with his arms still\nspread out, tumbling stiffly after us. So near were we, indeed, that my\nhead came against the coxswain\u2019s foot with a crack that made my teeth\nrattle.

        "804": "Now that I had a moment to myself, I lost no time in changing the\npriming of my pistol, and then, having one ready for service, and to\nmake assurance doubly sure, I proceeded to draw the load of the other\nand recharge it afresh from the beginning.\nMy new employment struck Hands all of a heap; he began to see the dice\ngoing against him, and after an obvious hesitation, he also hauled\nhimself heavily into the shrouds, and with the dirk in his teeth, began\nslowly and painfully to mount. It cost him no end of time and groans\nto haul his wounded leg behind him, and I had quietly finished my\narrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up. Then,\n",

        "806": "He stopped instantly. I could see by the working of his face that he was\ntrying to think, and the process was so slow and laborious that, in my\nnew-found security, I laughed aloud. At last, with a swallow or two, he\nspoke, his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity.\n",

        "834": "so that I could distinguish nothing by the eye. As for sounds, there\nwas the steady drone of the snorers and a small occasional noise, a\nflickering or pecking that I could in no way account for.\nWith my arms before me I walked steadily in. I should lie down in my own\n",

Soon, however, he saw that our party had the\nstart of him; and Ben Gunn, being fleet of foot, had been dispatched in\nfront to do his best alone. Then it had occurred to him to work upon the\n",

Yet there\nwere still three upon that island--Silver, and old Morgan, and Ben\nGunn--who had each taken his share in these crimes, as each had hoped in\nvain to share in the reward.\n",
        "1064": "\u201cCome in, Jim,\u201d said the captain. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boy in your line, Jim,\nbut I don\u2019t think you and me\u2019ll go to sea again. You\u2019re too much of the\nborn favourite for me. Is that you, John Silver? What brings you here,\n",

Never, I am sure, were people\ngayer or happier. And there was Silver, sitting back almost out of the\nfirelight, but eating heartily, prompt to spring forward when anything\nwas wanted, even joining quietly in our laughter--the same bland,\npolite, obsequious seaman of the voyage out.\n",
        "1067": "34\nAnd Last\nTHE next morning we fell early to work, for the transportation of this\ngreat mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach, and thence three\nmiles by boat to the HISPANIOLA, was a considerable task for so small\na number of workmen. The three fellows still abroad upon the island did\nnot greatly trouble us; a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was\nsufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught, and we thought,\nbesides, they had had more than enough of fighting.\nTherefore the work was pushed on briskly.

Accordingly, it was pretty gruffly that the doctor\nanswered him.\n\u201cDrunk or raving,\u201d said he.\n",
        "1073": "\u201cRight you were, sir,\u201d replied Silver; \u201cand precious little odds which,\nto you and me.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man,\u201d returned\nthe doctor with a sneer, \u201cand so my feelings may surprise you, Master\nSilver. But if I were sure they were raving--as I am morally certain\none, at least, of them is down with fever--I should leave this camp,\nand at whatever risk to my own carcass, take them the assistance of my\nskill.\u201d\n",
        "1074": "\u201cAsk your pardon, sir, you would be very wrong,\u201d quoth Silver. \u201cYou\nwould lose your precious life, and you may lay to that. I\u2019m on your side\nnow, hand and glove; and I shouldn\u2019t wish for to see the party weakened,\nlet alone yourself, seeing as I know what I owes you. But these men down\n",
        "1075": "there, they couldn\u2019t keep their word--no, not supposing they wished to;\nand what\u2019s more, they couldn\u2019t believe as you could.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cYou\u2019re the man to keep your word, we know that.\u201d\nWell, that was about the last news we had of the three pirates. Only\n",
        "1076": "once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting.\nA council was held, and it was decided that we must desert them on the\nisland--to the huge glee, I must say, of Ben Gunn, and with the strong\napproval of Gray. We left a good stock of powder and shot, the bulk\nof the salt goat, a few medicines, and some other necessaries, tools,\nclothing, a spare sail, a fathom or two of rope, and by the particular\ndesire of the doctor, a handsome present of tobacco.\n",
        "1077": "That was about our last doing on the island. Before that, we had got the\ntreasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the\ngoat meat in case of any distress; and at last, one fine morning, we\nweighed anchor, which was about all that we could manage, and stood out\nof North Inlet, the same colours flying that the captain had flown and\nfought under at the palisade.\nThe three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for,\nas we soon had proved. For coming through the narrows, we had to\n",
        "1078": "lie very near the southern point, and there we saw all three of\nthem kneeling together on a spit of sand, with their arms raised in\nsupplication. It went to all our hearts, I think, to leave them in that\nwretched state; but we could not risk another mutiny; and to take them\nhome for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness. The doctor\nhailed them and told them of the stores we had left, and where they were\nto find them. But they continued to call us by name and appeal to us,\n",
        "1079": "for God\u2019s sake, to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a\nplace.\nAt last, seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly\ndrawing out of earshot, one of them--I know not which it was--leapt to\nhis feet with a hoarse cry, whipped his musket to his shoulder, and sent\na shot whistling over Silver\u2019s head and through the main-sail.\nAfter that, we kept under cover of the bulwarks, and when next I looked\nout they had disappeared from the spit, and the spit itself had almost\nmelted out of sight in the growing distance. That was, at least, the end\n",
        "1080": "of that; and before noon, to my inexpressible joy, the highest rock of\nTreasure Island had sunk into the blue round of sea.\nWe were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand--only\nthe captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders, for\nthough greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet. We laid her\nhead for the nearest port in Spanish America, for we could not risk the\nvoyage home without fresh hands; and as it was, what with baffling winds\nand a couple of fresh gales, we were all worn out before we reached it.\n",
        "1081": "It was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful\nland-locked gulf, and were immediately surrounded by shore boats full\nof Negroes and Mexican Indians and half-bloods selling fruits and\nvegetables and offering to dive for bits of money. The sight of so many\ngood-humoured faces (especially the blacks), the taste of the tropical\nfruits, and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a\nmost charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island;\nand the doctor and the squire, taking me along with them, went ashore\nto pass the early part of the night. Here they met the captain of an\nEnglish man-of-war, fell in talk with him, went on board his ship, and,\nin short, had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came\nalongside the HISPANIOLA.\n",
        "1082": "Ben Gunn was on deck alone, and as soon as we came on board he began,\nwith wonderful contortions, to make us a confession. Silver was gone.\nThe maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago,\nand he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives, which\nwould certainly have been forfeit if \u201cthat man with the one leg\nhad stayed aboard.\u201d But this was not all. The sea-cook had not gone\nempty-handed. He had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed\n",
        "1083": "one of the sacks of coin, worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas,\nto help him on his further wanderings.\nI think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him.\nWell, to make a long story short, we got a few hands on board, made a\ngood cruise home, and the HISPANIOLA reached Bristol just as Mr. Blandly\n",
        "1084": "was beginning to think of fitting out her consort. Five men only of\nthose who had sailed returned with her. \u201cDrink and the devil had done\nfor the rest,\u201d with a vengeance, although, to be sure, we were not quite\nin so bad a case as that other ship they sang about:\n     With one man of her crew alive,\n     What put to sea with seventy-five.\n",
        "1085": "All of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or\nfoolishly, according to our natures. Captain Smollett is now retired\nfrom the sea. Gray not only saved his money, but being suddenly smit\nwith the desire to rise, also studied his profession, and he is now\nmate and part owner of a fine full-rigged ship, married besides, and the\nfather of a family. As for Ben Gunn, he got a thousand pounds, which he\n",

Then he was given a lodge to keep,\nexactly as he had feared upon the island; and he still lives, a great\nfavourite, though something of a butt, with the country boys, and a\nnotable singer in church on Sundays and saints\u2019 days.\nOf Silver we have heard no more. That formidable seafaring man with one\n",
        "1087": "leg has at last gone clean out of my life; but I dare say he met his old\nNegress, and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and Captain Flint.\nIt is to be hoped so, I suppose, for his chances of comfort in another\nworld are very small.\nThe bar silver and the arms still lie, for all that I know, where\nFlint buried them; and certainly they shall lie there for me.

        "1088": "wain-ropes would not bring me back again to that accursed island; and\nthe worst dreams that ever I have are when I hear the surf booming about\nits coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of Captain Flint\nstill ringing in my ears: \u201cPieces of eight!
