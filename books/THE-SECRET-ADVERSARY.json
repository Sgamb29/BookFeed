        "71": "all right. Well, there it is! I\u2019m ready and willing--but I never meet\nany rich men! All the boys I know are about as hard up as I am.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the general?\u201d inquired Tommy.\n",
        "72": "\u201cI fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace,\u201d explained Tuppence.\n\u201cNo, there it is! Now _you_ could marry a rich girl.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m like you. I don\u2019t know any.\u201d\n",

        "1264": "But why? At all costs he must try and get her away with him. Then his\nheart sank. Conrad was leaping down the stairs, uttering a savage cry at\nthe sight of him. After him came the others.\n",

        "1556": "was too easy, therefore it could not be. The hole would be empty.\nJulius looked at him with a widening smile.\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re rattled now all right,\u201d he drawled with some enjoyment.\n",
        "1557": "\u201cWell, here goes!\u201d He thrust his hand into the crevice, and made a\nslight grimace. \u201cIt\u2019s a tight fit. Jane\u2019s hand must be a few sizes\nsmaller than mine. I don\u2019t feel anything--no--say, what\u2019s this? Gee\n",
