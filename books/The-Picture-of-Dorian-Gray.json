        "17": "From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was\nlying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry\nWotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured\nblossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to\nbear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then\nthe fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long\ntussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,\nproducing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of\nthose pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of\nan art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of\nswiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their\nway through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous\ninsistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,\nseemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London\nwas like the bourdon note of a distant organ.\n",
        "18": "In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the\nfull-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,\nand in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist\nhimself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago\ncaused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many\nstrange conjectures.\nAs the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so\nskilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his\nface, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and\nclosing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought\nto imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he\nmight awake.\n",
        "19": "\u201cIt is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,\u201d said\nLord Henry languidly. \u201cYou must certainly send it next year to the\nGrosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have\ngone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been\nable to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that\nI have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor\n",
        "20": "is really the only place.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I shall send it anywhere,\u201d he answered, tossing his head\nback in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at\nOxford. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t send it anywhere.\u201d\nLord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through\nthe thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls\nfrom his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. \u201cNot send it anywhere? My dear\n",
        "21": "fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You\ndo anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one,\nyou seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is\n",
        "22": "only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is\nnot being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above\nall the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if\nold men are ever capable of any emotion.\u201d\n\u201cI know you will laugh at me,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut I really can\u2019t exhibit\nit. I have put too much of myself into it.\u201d\n",
        "23": "Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.\n\u201cYes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.\u201d\n\u201cToo much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn\u2019t know you\n",
        "24": "were so vain; and I really can\u2019t see any resemblance between you, with\nyour rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young\nAdonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,\nmy dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you\u2014well, of course you have an\nintellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends\nwhere an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode\n",
        "25": "of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one\nsits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something\nhorrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.\nHow perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But\n",
        "26": "then in the Church they don\u2019t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the\nage of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,\nand as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.\nYour mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but\nwhose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of\n",
        "27": "that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here\nin winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer\nwhen we want something to chill our intelligence. Don\u2019t flatter\nyourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.\u201d\n",
        "28": "\u201cYou don\u2019t understand me, Harry,\u201d answered the artist. \u201cOf course I am\nnot like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to\nlook like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.\n",
        "29": "There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,\nthe sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering\nsteps of kings. It is better not to be different from one\u2019s fellows.\nThe ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit\nat their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory,\n",
        "30": "they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all\nshould live\u2014undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They\nneither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.\n",
        "31": "Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are\u2014my art,\nwhatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray\u2019s good looks\u2014we shall all suffer\nfor what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\u201d\n\u201cDorian Gray? Is that his name?\u201d asked Lord Henry, walking across the\nstudio towards Basil Hallward.\n",
        "32": "\u201cYes, that is his name. I didn\u2019t intend to tell it to you.\u201d\n\u201cBut why not?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I can\u2019t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their\n",
        "33": "names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown\nto love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life\nmysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if\n",
        "34": "one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I\nam going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit,\nI dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into\none\u2019s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?\u201d\n",
        "35": "\u201cNot at all,\u201d answered Lord Henry, \u201cnot at all, my dear Basil. You seem\nto forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it\nmakes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I\nnever know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.\n",
        "36": "When we meet\u2014we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go\ndown to the Duke\u2019s\u2014we tell each other the most absurd stories with the\nmost serious faces. My wife is very good at it\u2014much better, in fact,\nthan I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But\nwhen she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish\n",
        "37": "she would; but she merely laughs at me.\u201d\n\u201cI hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,\u201d said Basil\nHallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. \u201cI\nbelieve that you are really a very good husband, but that you are\nthoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary\n",
        "38": "fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\nYour cynicism is simply a pose.\u201d\n\u201cBeing natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,\u201d\ncried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the\ngarden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that\nstood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the\n",
        "39": "polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.\nAfter a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. \u201cI am afraid I must be\ngoing, Basil,\u201d he murmured, \u201cand before I go, I insist on your\nanswering a question I put to you some time ago.\u201d\n",
        "40": "\u201cWhat is that?\u201d said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.\n\u201cYou know quite well.\u201d\n\u201cI do not, Harry.\u201d\n",
        "41": "\u201cWell, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you\nwon\u2019t exhibit Dorian Gray\u2019s picture. I want the real reason.\u201d\n\u201cI told you the real reason.\u201d\n",
        "42": "\u201cNo, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of\nyourself in it. Now, that is childish.\u201d\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, \u201cevery\nportrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not\nof the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is\n",
        "43": "not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on\nthe coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit\nthis picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of\nmy own soul.\u201d\nLord Henry laughed. \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d he asked.\n",
        "44": "\u201cI will tell you,\u201d said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came\nover his face.\n\u201cI am all expectation, Basil,\u201d continued his companion, glancing at\nhim.\n\u201cOh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,\u201d answered the painter;\n\u201cand I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly\n",
        "45": "believe it.\u201d\nLord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from\nthe grass and examined it. \u201cI am quite sure I shall understand it,\u201d he\nreplied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,\n\u201cand as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it\nis quite incredible.\u201d\n",
        "46": "The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy\nlilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the\nlanguid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a\nblue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze\nwings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward\u2019s heart\nbeating, and wondered what was coming.\n",
        "47": "\u201cThe story is simply this,\u201d said the painter after some time. \u201cTwo\nmonths ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon\u2019s. You know we poor\nartists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to\nremind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a\n",
        "48": "white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain\na reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room\nabout ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious\nacademicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at\nme. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.\nWhen our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation\n",
        "49": "of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some\none whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to\ndo so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art\nitself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know\nyourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my\n",
        "50": "own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.\nThen\u2014but I don\u2019t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to\ntell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had\n",
        "51": "a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and\nexquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was\nnot conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take\nno credit to myself for trying to escape.\u201d\n",
        "52": "\u201cConscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience\nis the trade-name of the firm. That is all.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that, Harry, and I don\u2019t believe you do either.\n",
        "53": "However, whatever was my motive\u2014and it may have been pride, for I used\nto be very proud\u2014I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I\nstumbled against Lady Brandon. \u2018You are not going to run away so soon,\nMr. Hallward?\u2019 she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill voice?\u201d\n",
        "54": "\u201cYes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,\u201d said Lord Henry,\npulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.\n\u201cI could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people\nwith stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and\nparrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her\n",
        "55": "once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe\nsome picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had\nbeen chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the\nnineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself\nface to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely\nstirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again.\n",
        "56": "It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.\nPerhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We\nwould have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of\n",
        "57": "that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined\nto know each other.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?\u201d asked his\n",
        "58": "companion. \u201cI know she goes in for giving a rapid _pr\u00e9cis_ of all her\nguests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old\ngentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my\near, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to\neverybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I\n",
        "59": "like to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests\nexactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them\nentirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants\nto know.\u201d\n",
        "60": "\u201cPoor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!\u201d said Hallward\nlistlessly.\n\u201cMy dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in\nopening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she\n",
        "61": "say about Mr. Dorian Gray?\u201d\n\u201cOh, something like, \u2018Charming boy\u2014poor dear mother and I absolutely\ninseparable. Quite forget what he does\u2014afraid he\u2014doesn\u2019t do\nanything\u2014oh, yes, plays the piano\u2014or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?\u2019\n",
        "62": "Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.\u201d\n\u201cLaughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far\nthe best ending for one,\u201d said the young lord, plucking another daisy.\nHallward shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what friendship is,\n",
        "63": "Harry,\u201d he murmured\u2014\u201cor what enmity is, for that matter. You like every\none; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.\u201d\n\u201cHow horribly unjust of you!\u201d cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back\n",
        "64": "and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of\nglossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the\nsummer sky. \u201cYes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference\nbetween people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my\nacquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good\nintellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I\n",
        "65": "have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual\npower, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of\nme? I think it is rather vain.\u201d\n",
        "66": "\u201cI should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be\nmerely an acquaintance.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.\u201d\n",
        "67": "\u201cAnd much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?\u201d\n\u201cOh, brothers! I don\u2019t care for brothers. My elder brother won\u2019t die,\nand my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.\u201d\n",
        "68": "\u201cHarry!\u201d exclaimed Hallward, frowning.\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can\u2019t help detesting my\nrelations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand\n",
        "69": "other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize\nwith the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices\nof the upper orders.

        "75": "your art.\u201d\n\u201cHe is all my art to me now,\u201d said the painter gravely. \u201cI sometimes\nthink, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the\nworld\u2019s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,\n",
        "76": "and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.\nWhat the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of\nAntinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will\nsome day be to me.

Two of the people he had never seen\nbefore, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those\nmiddle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies,\nbut are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Ruxton, an\noverdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, who was always\ntrying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly plain that to\nher great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against\nher; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and\nVenetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his hostess\u2019s daughter, a dowdy\ndull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once\nseen, are never remembered; and her husband, a red-cheeked,\nwhite-whiskered creature who, like so many of his class, was under the\nimpression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of\nideas.\n",

        "1284": "\u201cShe is still _d\u00e9collet\u00e9e_,\u201d he answered, taking an olive in his long\nfingers; \u201cand when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an\n_\u00e9dition de luxe_ of a bad French novel.
