        "5": "CHAPTER XIII. POIROT EXPLAINS\nCHAPTER I.\nI GO TO STYLES\nThe intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the\ntime as \u201cThe Styles Case\u201d has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in\n",
        "6": "view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked,\nboth by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account\nof the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the\nsensational rumours which still persist.\nI will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my\nbeing connected with the affair.\n",
        "7": "I had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some\nmonths in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month\u2019s\nsick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make\nup my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen\nvery little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him\n",
        "8": "particularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one\nthing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though,\nI had often stayed at Styles, his mother\u2019s place in Essex.\n",
        "9": "We had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me\ndown to Styles to spend my leave there.\n\u201cThe mater will be delighted to see you again\u2014after all those years,\u201d\nhe added.\n\u201cYour mother keeps well?\u201d I asked.\n",
        "10": "\u201cOh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?\u201d\nI am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who\nhad married John\u2019s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been\na handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could\n",
        "11": "not be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,\nautocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social\nnotoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady\nBountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable\nfortune of her own.\n",
        "12": "Their country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish\nearly in their married life. He had been completely under his wife\u2019s\nascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her\nlifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that\nwas distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, had\n",
        "13": "always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the\ntime of their father\u2019s remarriage that they always thought of her as\ntheir own mother.\nLawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a\ndoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at\nhome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any\nmarked success.\n",
        "14": "John practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled\ndown to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two\nyears ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I\nentertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother\nto increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home\nof his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her\nown plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this\ncase she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.\n",
        "15": "John noticed my surprise at the news of his mother\u2019s remarriage and\nsmiled rather ruefully.\n\u201cRotten little bounder too!\u201d he said savagely. \u201cI can tell you,\nHastings, it\u2019s making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie\u2014you\n",
        "16": "remember Evie?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I suppose she was after your time. She\u2019s the mater\u2019s factotum,\n",
        "17": "companion, Jack of all trades! A great sport\u2014old Evie! Not precisely\nyoung and beautiful, but as game as they make them.\u201d\n\u201cYou were going to say\u2014\u2014?\u201d\n",
        "18": "\u201cOh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a\nsecond cousin or something of Evie\u2019s, though she didn\u2019t seem\nparticularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an\nabsolute outsider, anyone can see that. He\u2019s got a great black beard,\n",
        "19": "and wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned\nto him at once, took him on as secretary\u2014you know how she\u2019s always\nrunning a hundred societies?\u201d\nI nodded.\n",
        "20": "\u201cWell, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No\ndoubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us\nall down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced\nthat she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty\n",
        "21": "years younger than she is! It\u2019s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but\nthere you are\u2014she is her own mistress, and she\u2019s married him.\u201d\n\u201cIt must be a difficult situation for you all.\u201d\n",
        "22": "\u201cDifficult! It\u2019s damnable!\u201d\nThus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train\nat Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason\nfor existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country\nlanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out\n",
        "23": "to the car.\n\u201cGot a drop or two of petrol still, you see,\u201d he remarked. \u201cMainly\nowing to the mater\u2019s activities.\u201d\n",
        "24": "The village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the\nlittle station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It\nwas a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat\n",
        "25": "Essex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it\nseemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great\nwar was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed\ninto another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.\u201d\n",
        "26": "\u201cMy dear fellow, that\u2019s just what I want.\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill\nwith the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife\n",
        "27": "works regularly \u2018on the land\u2019. She is up at five every morning to milk,\nand keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It\u2019s a jolly good life taking\nit all round\u2014if it weren\u2019t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!\u201d He\n",
        "28": "checked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. \u201cI wonder if we\u2019ve\ntime to pick up Cynthia. No, she\u2019ll have started from the hospital by\nnow.\u201d\n",
        "29": "\u201cCynthia! That\u2019s not your wife?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Cynthia is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of my mother\u2019s, the daughter of an old\nschoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a\ncropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came\n",
        "30": "to the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She\nworks in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.\u201d\nAs he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.\n",
        "31": "A lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,\nstraightened herself at our approach.\n\u201cHullo, Evie, here\u2019s our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings\u2014Miss Howard.\u201d\nMiss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had an\n",
        "32": "impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a\npleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly\nin its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with\nfeet to match\u2014these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation,\nI soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.\n",
        "33": "\u201cWeeds grow like house afire. Can\u2019t keep even with \u2019em. Shall press you\nin. Better be careful.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,\u201d I\nresponded.\n",
        "34": "\u201cDon\u2019t say it. Never does. Wish you hadn\u2019t later.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a cynic, Evie,\u201d said John, laughing. \u201cWhere\u2019s tea to-day\u2014inside\nor out?\u201d\n",
        "35": "\u201cOut. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.\u201d\n\u201cCome on then, you\u2019ve done enough gardening for to-day. \u2018The labourer\nis worthy of his hire\u2019, you know. Come and be refreshed.\u201d\n",
        "36": "\u201cWell,\u201d said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, \u201cI\u2019m\ninclined to agree with you.\u201d\nShe led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade\nof a large sycamore.\nA figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to\nmeet us.\n",
        "37": "\u201cMy wife, Hastings,\u201d said John.\nI shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall,\nslender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of\nslumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful\ntawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman\u2019s\nthat I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,\nwhich nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in\nan exquisitely civilised body\u2014all these things are burnt into my\nmemory. I shall never forget them.\n",
        "38": "She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear\nvoice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I\nhad accepted John\u2019s invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and\nher few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a\nthoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always\nstimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents\nof my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly\namused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he is, could\n",
        "39": "hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.\nAt that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French\nwindow near at hand:\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I\u2019ll write to\nLady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we\n",
        "40": "hear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might\nopen it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there\u2019s the\nDuchess\u2014about the school f\u00eate.\u201d\n",
        "41": "There was the murmur of a man\u2019s voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s rose\nin reply:\n\u201cYes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful,\nAlfred dear.\u201d\n",
        "42": "The French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome\nwhite-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,\nstepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of\ndeference in his manner.\nMrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.\n",
        "43": "\u201cWhy, if it isn\u2019t too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after\nall these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings\u2014my husband.\u201d\nI looked with some curiosity at \u201cAlfred darling\u201d. He certainly struck a\n",
        "44": "rather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It\nwas one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore\ngold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It\n",
        "45": "struck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out\nof place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He\nplaced a wooden hand in mine and said:\n\u201cThis is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings.\u201d Then, turning to his wife: \u201cEmily\ndearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.\u201d\n",
        "46": "She beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every\ndemonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an\notherwise sensible woman!\nWith the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled\n",
        "47": "hostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in\nparticular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp,\nhowever, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I\n",
        "48": "remembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she\npoured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the\nforthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place\nshortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of\ndays or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the\nvery first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter\nmyself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.\n",
        "49": "Presently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about\nletters to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his\npainstaking voice:\n\u201cIs soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?\u201d\n\u201cNo, before the war I was in Lloyd\u2019s.\u201d\n",
        "50": "\u201cAnd you will return there after it is over?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.\u201d\nMary Cavendish leant forward.\n",
        "51": "\u201cWhat would you really choose as a profession, if you could just\nconsult your inclination?\u201d\n\u201cWell, that depends.\u201d\n\u201cNo secret hobby?\u201d she asked. \u201cTell me\u2014you\u2019re drawn to something?\n",
        "52": "Everyone is\u2014usually something absurd.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll laugh at me.\u201d\nShe smiled.\n",
        "53": "\u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!\u201d\n\u201cThe real thing\u2014Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?\u201d\n",
        "54": "\u201cOh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully\ndrawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous\ndetective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow.\n",
        "55": "He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of\nmethod. My system is based on his\u2014though of course I have progressed\nrather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but\nwonderfully clever.\u201d\n",
        "56": "\u201cLike a good detective story myself,\u201d remarked Miss Howard. \u201cLots of\nnonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Everyone\ndumbfounded. Real crime\u2014you\u2019d know at once.\u201d\n",
        "57": "\u201cThere have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,\u201d I argued.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The\nfamily. You couldn\u2019t really hoodwink them. They\u2019d know.\u201d\n",
        "58": "\u201cThen,\u201d I said, much amused, \u201cyou think that if you were mixed up in a\ncrime, say a murder, you\u2019d be able to spot the murderer right off?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I should. Mightn\u2019t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.\nBut I\u2019m certain I\u2019d know. I\u2019d feel it in my fingertips if he came near\n",
        "59": "me.\u201d\n\u201cIt might be a \u2018she\u2019,\u201d I suggested.\n\u201cMight. But murder\u2019s a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.\u201d\n",
        "60": "\u201cNot in a case of poisoning.\u201d Mrs. Cavendish\u2019s clear voice startled me.\n\u201cDr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general\nignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,\nthere were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.\u201d\n",
        "61": "\u201cWhy, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!\u201d cried Mrs. Inglethorp. \u201cIt\nmakes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there\u2019s\nCynthia!\u201d\n",
        "62": "A young girl in V.A.D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.\n\u201cWhy, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings\u2014Miss Murdoch.\u201d\nCynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and\nvigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap, and I admired the great\n",
        "63": "loose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the\nhand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she\nwould have been a beauty.\nShe flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a\nplate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.\n",
        "64": "\u201cSit down here on the grass, do. It\u2019s ever so much nicer.\u201d\nI dropped down obediently.\n\u201cYou work at Tadminster, don\u2019t you, Miss Murdoch?\u201d\n",
        "65": "She nodded.\n\u201cFor my sins.\u201d\n\u201cDo they bully you, then?\u201d I asked, smiling.\n",
        "66": "\u201cI should like to see them!\u201d cried Cynthia with dignity.\n\u201cI have got a cousin who is nursing,\u201d I remarked. \u201cAnd she is terrified\nof \u2018Sisters\u2019.\u201d\n",
        "67": "\u201cI don\u2019t wonder. Sisters _are_, you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp-ly\n_are_! You\u2019ve no idea! But I\u2019m not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the\ndispensary.\u201d\n",
        "68": "\u201cHow many people do you poison?\u201d I asked, smiling.\nCynthia smiled too.\n\u201cOh, hundreds!\u201d she said.\n",
        "69": "\u201cCynthia,\u201d called Mrs. Inglethorp, \u201cdo you think you could write a few\nnotes for me?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, Aunt Emily.\u201d\n",
        "70": "She jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that\nher position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she\nmight be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.\nMy hostess turned to me.\n",
        "71": "\u201cJohn will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have\ngiven up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member\u2019s\nwife\u2014she was the late Lord Abbotsbury\u2019s daughter\u2014does the same. She\n",
        "72": "agrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a\nwar household; nothing is wasted here\u2014every scrap of waste paper, even,\nis saved and sent away in sacks.\u201d\nI expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the\nbroad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different\nwings of the building.

        "74": "shadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked\nabout forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some\nviolent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window\n",
        "75": "as he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the\nfifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. It was John\u2019s younger\nbrother, Lawrence Cavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought\nthat singular expression to his face.\n",
        "76": "Then I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of\nmy own affairs.\nThe evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that\nenigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.\nThe next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the\nanticipation of a delightful visit.\n",
        "77": "I did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to\ntake me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the\nwoods, returning to the house about five.\nAs we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the\nsmoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had\n",

        "80": "Miss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together, and she carried\na small suit-case. She looked excited and determined, and slightly on\nthe defensive.\n",

        "656": "The jury looked up, interested.\n\u201cI believe,\u201d continued Lawrence, \u201cthat there have been cases where the\ncumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by\ncausing death. Also, is it not possible that she may have taken an\noverdose of her medicine by accident?\u201d\n",

        "659": "absurd.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently\ntaken an overdose?\u201d\n",

Mrs.\nInglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a\ntime, as she dealt with Coot\u2019s, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She\nwould have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the\namount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.\u201d\n",
        "661": "\u201cThen you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any\nway instrumental in causing her death?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly. The supposition is ridiculous.\u201d\nThe same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the\nchemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.\n",
        "662": "\u201cThat, of course, is always possible,\u201d replied the doctor.\nBut Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that\npossibility. The medicine had not been newly made up. On the contrary,\nMrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.\n",
        "663": "So the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the Coroner\nproceeded with his task. Having elicited from Dorcas how she had been\nawakened by the violent ringing of her mistress\u2019s bell, and had\nsubsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the\nquarrel on the preceding afternoon.\nDorcas\u2019s evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had\nalready heard, so I will not repeat it here.\n",
        "664": "The next witness was Mary Cavendish. She stood very upright, and spoke\nin a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. In answer to the\nCoroner\u2019s question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at\nfour-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the\nsound of something heavy falling.\n",
        "665": "\u201cThat would have been the table by the bed?\u201d commented the Coroner.\n\u201cI opened my door,\u201d continued Mary, \u201cand listened. In a few minutes a\nbell rang violently. Dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and\n",

I\nfelt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the\nlittle lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied\nquietly enough:\n\u201cNo. I was very comfortable where I was. I fixed my mind on my book.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that is all you can tell us?\u201d\n",
        "678": "\u201cThat is all.\u201d\nThe examination was over, though I doubted if the Coroner was entirely\nsatisfied with it. I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell\nmore if she chose.\n",

        "862": "everybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,\nthat they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss\nHoward\u2019s having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, she was devoted to her!\u201d I exclaimed.\n",
        "863": "\u201cTcha! Tcha!\u201d cried Poirot irritably. \u201cYou argue like a child. If Miss\nHoward were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite\nequally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You\nare perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against\nAlfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong\nin the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions,\n",
        "864": "which I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at\npresent.\u201d He paused a minute, then went on. \u201cNow, to my way of\nthinking, there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard\u2019s being the\nmurderess.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that is?\u201d\n",
        "865": "\u201cThat in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s death benefit Miss\nHoward. Now there is no murder without a motive.\u201d\nI reflected.\n",
        "866": "\u201cCould not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour?\u201d\nPoirot shook his head.\n\u201cBut you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells?\u201d\n",
        "867": "Poirot smiled.\n\u201cThat was for a reason. I did not want to mention the name of the\nperson who was actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the\n",
        "868": "same position, so I used her name instead.\u201d\n\u201cStill, Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so. Why, that will, made on the\nafternoon of her death may\u2014\u2014\u201d\nBut Poirot\u2019s shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped.\n",
        "869": "\u201cNo, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.\nBut I can tell you this much\u2014it was not in Miss Howard\u2019s favour.\u201d\nI accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be\nso positive about the matter.\n",
        "870": "\u201cWell,\u201d I said, with a sigh, \u201cwe will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is\npartly your fault that I ever came to suspect her. It was what you said\nabout her evidence at the inquest that set me off.\u201d\n",
        "871": "Poirot looked puzzled.\n\u201cWhat did I say about her evidence at the inquest?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember? When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above\n",
        "872": "suspicion?\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2014ah\u2014yes.\u201d He seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. \u201cBy\nthe way, Hastings, there is something I want you to do for me.\u201d\n",
        "873": "\u201cCertainly. What is it?\u201d\n\u201cNext time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you\nto say this to him. \u2018I have a message for you, from Poirot. He says:\n\u201cFind the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!\u201d\u2019 Nothing more.\n",
        "874": "Nothing less.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.\u2019 Is that\nright?\u201d I asked, much mystified.\n",
        "875": "\u201cExcellent.\u201d\n\u201cBut what does it mean?\u201d\n\u201cAh, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the facts.\n",
        "876": "Just say that to him, and see what he says.\u201d\n\u201cVery well\u2014but it\u2019s all extremely mysterious.\u201d\nWe were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the\n\u201cAnalytical Chemist.\u201d\n",
        "877": "Poirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. In a few minutes he was\nback again.\n\u201cThere,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is all my business.\u201d\n",
        "878": "\u201cWhat were you doing there?\u201d I asked, in lively curiosity.\n\u201cI left something to be analysed.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but what?\u201d\n",
        "879": "\u201cThe sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.\u201d\n\u201cBut that has already been tested!\u201d I cried, stupefied. \u201cDr. Bauerstein\nhad it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there\nbeing strychnine in it.\u201d\n",
        "880": "\u201cI know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,\u201d replied Poirot quietly.\n\u201cWell, then?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.\u201d\n",
        "881": "And not another word on the subject could I drag out of him.\nThis proceeding of Poirot\u2019s, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me\nintensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my\nconfidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully\nrestored since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp\u2019s innocence had been so\ntriumphantly vindicated.\n",
        "882": "The funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took place the following day, and on\nMonday, as I came down to a late breakfast, John drew me aside, and\ninformed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up\nhis quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his\nplans.\n",
        "883": "\u201cAnd really it\u2019s a great relief to think he\u2019s going, Hastings,\u201d\ncontinued my honest friend. \u201cIt was bad enough before, when we thought\nhe\u2019d done it, but I\u2019m hanged if it isn\u2019t worse now, when we all feel\nguilty for having been so down on the fellow. The fact is, we\u2019ve\ntreated him abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I\n",
        "884": "don\u2019t see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we\ndid. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there\u2019s a\nbeastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when\none doesn\u2019t like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole\nthing\u2019s damned awkward! And I\u2019m thankful he\u2019s had the tact to take\n",
        "885": "himself off. It\u2019s a good thing Styles wasn\u2019t the mater\u2019s to leave to\nhim. Couldn\u2019t bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He\u2019s welcome\nto her money.\u201d\n",
        "886": "\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to keep up the place all right?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my father\u2019s\nmoney goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the\npresent, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first,\n",

Still, the Johnnies will wait now.\u201d\nIn the general relief at Inglethorp\u2019s approaching departure, we had the\nmost genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. Cynthia,\nwhose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her\npretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who\nseemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the\nopening of a new and hopeful future.\n",
        "888": "The papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. Glaring headlines,\nsandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle\ninnuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue.\nNothing was spared us. It was a slack time. The war was momentarily\n",
        "889": "inactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in\nfashionable life: \u201cThe Mysterious Affair at Styles\u201d was the topic of\nthe moment.\nNaturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes. The house was\nconstantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied\nadmission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,\nwhere they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the\nhousehold. We all lived in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men\n",

        "915": "\u201cTrue, but you are not sufficient.\u201d\nI was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself.\n\u201cYou do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me.\n",

        "918": "Still, we can but try.\u201d\nWith a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirot\u2019s\nrequest for a few minutes\u2019 conversation.\nWe went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door.\n",

        "1066": "Thinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly\nunsatisfactory.\nIt occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and\nlook up Bauerstein.

        "1076": "Of course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to\nconceal Dr. Bauerstein\u2019s arrest from her. It would be announced in\nevery newspaper on the morrow.

        "1078": "After some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and\nleave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.\nHe gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news.\n\u201cGreat Scott! You _were_ right, then. I couldn\u2019t believe it at the\n",

        "1080": "John reflected.\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d he said at last, \u201cwe won\u2019t say anything at present. There\nis no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough.\u201d\n",
        "1081": "But to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and\neagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest!\nThere was a column of mere padding about \u201cThe Styles Poisoning Case,\u201d\nbut nothing further.

        "1082": "worried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there\nmight be further arrests to come.\nAfter breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if Poirot\nhad returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known face blocked\none of the windows, and the well-known voice said:\n\u201c_Bonjour, mon ami!_\u201d\n\u201cPoirot,\u201d I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I\ndragged him into the room. \u201cI was never so glad to see anyone.
