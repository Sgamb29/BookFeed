With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe\n",

No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources\nof human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life\nupon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of\n",
        "14": "the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men\nfancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to\nthemselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the\ngulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the\nbeasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic,\nregarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their\nplans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great\n",

It\nmust be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world;\nand long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface\nmust have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of\n",
        "16": "the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the\ntemperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all\nthat is necessary for the support of animated existence.\nYet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to\nthe very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that\nintelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,\nbeyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood that since\n",
        "17": "Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the\nsuperficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that\nit is not only more distant from time\u2019s beginning but nearer its end.\nThe secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already\ngone far indeed with our neighbour. Its physical condition is still\nlargely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial region\nthe midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter.\n",
        "18": "Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until\nthey cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change\nhuge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically\ninundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which to\nus is still incredibly remote, has become a present-day problem for the\ninhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened\ntheir intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And\n",
        "19": "looking across space with instruments, and intelligences such as we\nhave scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only\n35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own\nwarmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy\natmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting\ncloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow,\nnavy-crowded seas.\nAnd we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at\nleast as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The\nintellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant\nstruggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief\nof the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this\n",

To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their\nonly escape from the destruction that, generation after generation,\ncreeps upon them.\nAnd before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless\nand utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon\nanimals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior\nraces.

Are we such apostles of mercy\nas to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\nThe Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing\nsubtlety\u2014their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of\nours\u2014and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh\nperfect unanimity. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have seen\n",

Men like\nSchiaparelli watched the red planet\u2014it is odd, by-the-bye, that for\ncountless centuries Mars has been the star of war\u2014but failed to\ninterpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so\nwell. All that time the Martians must have been getting ready.\nDuring the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated\npart of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of\nNice, and then by other observers. English readers heard of it first in\n",
        "23": "the issue of _Nature_ dated August 2. I am inclined to think that this\nblaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk\ninto their planet, from which their shots were fired at us. Peculiar\nmarkings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak\nduring the next two oppositions.\n",
        "24": "The storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached\nopposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange\npalpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of\nincandescent gas upon the planet. It had occurred towards midnight of\nthe twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted,\nindicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an\nenormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of fire had become\n",
        "25": "invisible about a quarter past twelve. He compared it to a colossal\npuff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, \u201cas\nflaming gases rushed out of a gun.\u201d\nA singularly appropriate phrase it proved. Yet the next day there was\n",
        "26": "nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _Daily\nTelegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest\ndangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of\nthe eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer, at\nOttershaw. He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess of\nhis feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a\nscrutiny of the red planet.\n",
        "27": "In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vigil\nvery distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed lantern\nthrowing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady ticking\nof the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in the roof\u2014an\noblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved\nabout, invisible but audible. Looking through the telescope, one saw a\ncircle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field.\n",
        "28": "It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and still, faintly\nmarked with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect\nround. But so little it was, so silvery warm\u2014a pin\u2019s head of light! It\nwas as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope vibrating with\nthe activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view.\nAs I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to\nadvance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired. Forty\n",
        "29": "millions of miles it was from us\u2014more than forty millions of miles of\nvoid. Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of\nthe material universe swims.\nNear it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light,\nthree telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the\nunfathomable darkness of empty space. You know how that blackness looks\n",
        "30": "on a frosty starlight night. In a telescope it seems far profounder.\nAnd invisible to me because it was so remote and small, flying swiftly\nand steadily towards me across that incredible distance, drawing nearer\nevery minute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were\nsending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity\nand death to the earth. I never dreamed of it then as I watched; no one\non earth dreamed of that unerring missile.\n",
        "31": "That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the distant\nplanet. I saw it. A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest projection\nof the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I\ntold Ogilvy and he took my place. The night was warm and I was thirsty,\nand I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the\ndarkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy\nexclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.\n",
        "32": "That night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth\nfrom Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first\none. I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with\npatches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes. I wished I had a\nlight to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I\nhad seen and all that it would presently bring me. Ogilvy watched till\n",
        "33": "one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his\nhouse. Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all\ntheir hundreds of people, sleeping in peace.\nHe was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars, and\nscoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were\nsignalling us. His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy\n",
        "34": "shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in\nprogress. He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic\nevolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets.\n\u201cThe chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one,\u201d he\nsaid.\n",
        "35": "Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after\nabout midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a\nflame each night. Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth\nhas attempted to explain. It may be the gases of the firing caused the\nMartians inconvenience.

The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember, made a happy\nuse of it in the political cartoon. And, all unsuspected, those\n",
        "37": "missiles the Martians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a\npace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space, hour by\nhour and day by day, nearer and nearer. It seems to me now almost\nincredibly wonderful that, with that swift fate hanging over us, men\ncould go about their petty concerns as they did. I remember how\njubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the\nillustrated paper he edited in those days. People in these latter times\n",
        "38": "scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century\npapers. For my own part, I was much occupied in learning to ride the\nbicycle, and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable\ndevelopments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed.\nOne night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10,000,000\nmiles away) I went for a walk with my wife. It was starlight and I\n",

From the railway station in the distance came the\n",
        "40": "sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into\nmelody by the distance. My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the\nred, green, and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the\nsky. It seemed so safe and tranquil.\nII.\n",
        "41": "THE FALLING STAR.\nThen came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the\nmorning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the\natmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary\n",
        "42": "falling star. Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it\nthat glowed for some seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on\nmeteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about\nninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to him that it fell to earth\n",
        "43": "about one hundred miles east of him.\nI was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my\nFrench windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved\nin those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it. Yet\nthis strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space\nmust have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only\nlooked up as it passed. Some of those who saw its flight say it\n",
        "44": "travelled with a hissing sound. I myself heard nothing of that. Many\npeople in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of\nit, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended. No\none seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.\n",
        "45": "But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the shooting\nstar and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common\nbetween Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the idea of\nfinding it. Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from the\nsand-pits. An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the\nprojectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every\ndirection over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half away.\n",
        "46": "The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose against\nthe dawn.\nThe Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the\nscattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its\ndescent. The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder,\ncaked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured\nincrustation. It had a diameter of about thirty yards. He approached\n",
        "47": "the mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since most\nmeteorites are rounded more or less completely. It was, however, still\nso hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach.\nA stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling\nof its surface; for at that time it had not occurred to him that it\nmight be hollow.\n",
        "48": "He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made for\nitself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its\nunusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some evidence\nof design in its arrival. The early morning was wonderfully still, and\nthe sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already\nwarm. He did not remember hearing any birds that morning, there was\ncertainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the faint\nmovements from within the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on the\n",
        "49": "common.\nThen suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker,\nthe ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling off the\ncircular edge of the end. It was dropping off in flakes and raining\ndown upon the sand. A large piece suddenly came off and fell with a\n",
        "50": "sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth.\nFor a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although the\nheat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to\nsee the Thing more clearly. He fancied even then that the cooling of\nthe body might account for this, but what disturbed that idea was the\nfact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder.\n",
        "51": "And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the\ncylinder was rotating on its body. It was such a gradual movement that\nhe discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been\nnear him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the\ncircumference. Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated,\nuntil he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk\nforward an inch or so. Then the thing came upon him in a flash. The\n",
        "52": "cylinder was artificial\u2014hollow\u2014with an end that screwed out! Something\nwithin the cylinder was unscrewing the top!\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d said Ogilvy. \u201cThere\u2019s a man in it\u2014men in it! Half\n",
        "53": "roasted to death! Trying to escape!\u201d\nAt once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the flash\nupon Mars.\nThe thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he\nforgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn. But\n",
        "54": "luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands\non the still-glowing metal. At that he stood irresolute for a moment,\nthen turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running wildly into\nWoking. The time then must have been somewhere about six o\u2019clock. He\nmet a waggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale he told\nand his appearance were so wild\u2014his hat had fallen off in the pit\u2014that\nthe man simply drove on. He was equally unsuccessful with the potman\n",
        "55": "who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by Horsell Bridge.\nThe fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful\nattempt to shut him into the taproom. That sobered him a little; and\nwhen he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in his garden, he called\nover the palings and made himself understood.\n",
        "56": "\u201cHenderson,\u201d he called, \u201cyou saw that shooting star last night?\u201d\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Henderson.\n\u201cIt\u2019s out on Horsell Common now.\u201d\n",
        "57": "\u201cGood Lord!\u201d said Henderson. \u201cFallen meteorite! That\u2019s good.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s something more than a meteorite. It\u2019s a cylinder\u2014an\nartificial cylinder, man! And there\u2019s something inside.\u201d\n",
        "58": "Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he said. He was deaf in one ear.\nOgilvy told him all that he had seen. Henderson was a minute or so\n",
        "59": "taking it in. Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and\ncame out into the road. The two men hurried back at once to the common,\nand found the cylinder still lying in the same position. But now the\n",
        "60": "sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed\nbetween the top and the body of the cylinder. Air was either entering\nor escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.\nThey listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and,\nmeeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside\nmust be insensible or dead.\n",
        "61": "Of course the two were quite unable to do anything. They shouted\nconsolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to get\nhelp. One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and disordered,\nrunning up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop\nfolks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their\nbedroom windows. Henderson went into the railway station at once, in\n",

        "63": "form the story took. I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a\nquarter to nine when I went out to get my _Daily Chronicle_. I was\nnaturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across the\nOttershaw bridge to the sand-pits.\n",
        "64": "III.\nON HORSELL COMMON.\nI found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge\nhole in which the cylinder lay. I have already described the appearance\n",
        "65": "of that colossal bulk, embedded in the ground. The turf and gravel\nabout it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion. No doubt its\nimpact had caused a flash of fire. Henderson and Ogilvy were not there.\n",
        "66": "I think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present, and\nhad gone away to breakfast at Henderson\u2019s house.\nThere were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with their\nfeet dangling, and amusing themselves\u2014until I stopped them\u2014by throwing\nstones at the giant mass. After I had spoken to them about it, they\nbegan playing at \u201ctouch\u201d in and out of the group of bystanders.\n",
        "67": "Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I employed\nsometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his little\nboy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to\nhang about the railway station. There was very little talking. Few of\nthe common people in England had anything but the vaguest astronomical\nideas in those days. Most of them were staring quietly at the big table\nlike end of the cylinder, which was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had\nleft it. I fancy the popular expectation of a heap of charred corpses\n",

        "69": "rotate.\nIt was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of this\nobject was at all evident to me.

        "70": "required a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the\ngrey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, that the yellowish-white\nmetal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an\nunfamiliar hue. \u201cExtra-terrestrial\u201d had no meaning for most of the\nonlookers.\nAt that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had come\nfrom the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it contained any\nliving creature. I thought the unscrewing might be automatic. In spite\n",
        "71": "of Ogilvy, I still believed that there were men in Mars. My mind ran\nfancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript, on the\ndifficulties in translation that might arise, whether we should find\ncoins and models in it, and so forth. Yet it was a little too large for\nassurance on this idea. I felt an impatience to see it opened. About\n",
        "72": "eleven, as nothing seemed happening, I walked back, full of such\nthought, to my home in Maybury. But I found it difficult to get to work\nupon my abstract investigations.\nIn the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much.\n",
        "73": "The early editions of the evening papers had startled London with\nenormous headlines:\n\u201cA MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS.\u201d\n\u201cREMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,\u201d\nand so forth. In addition, Ogilvy\u2019s wire to the Astronomical Exchange\nhad roused every observatory in the three kingdoms.\n",
        "74": "There were half a dozen flys or more from the Woking station standing\nin the road by the sand-pits, a basket-chaise from Chobham, and a\nrather lordly carriage. Besides that, there was quite a heap of\nbicycles. In addition, a large number of people must have walked, in\nspite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there\nwas altogether quite a considerable crowd\u2014one or two gaily dressed\nladies among the others.\n",
        "75": "It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind, and\nthe only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees. The burning\nheather had been extinguished, but the level ground towards Ottershaw\nwas blackened as far as one could see, and still giving off vertical\nstreamers of smoke. An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the Chobham\nRoad had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green apples and ginger\nbeer.\n",
        "76": "Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of about\nhalf a dozen men\u2014Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man that I\nafterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with several\nworkmen wielding spades and pickaxes. Stent was giving directions in a\nclear, high-pitched voice. He was standing on the cylinder, which was\nnow evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and streaming with\nperspiration, and something seemed to have irritated him.\n",
        "77": "A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its lower\nend was still embedded. As soon as Ogilvy saw me among the staring\ncrowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down, and asked me\nif I would mind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor.\nThe growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to their\nexcavations, especially the boys. They wanted a light railing put up,\n",
        "78": "and help to keep the people back. He told me that a faint stirring was\noccasionally still audible within the case, but that the workmen had\nfailed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them. The case\nappeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that the faint\nsounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior.\n",

I failed to find Lord\nHilton at his house, but I was told he was expected from London by the\nsix o\u2019clock train from Waterloo; and as it was then about a quarter\npast five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up to the station to\nwaylay him.\nIV.\n",
        "80": "THE CYLINDER OPENS.\nWhen I returned to the common the sun was setting. Scattered groups\nwere hurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two persons were\nreturning. The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out black\n",

        "84": "\u201cKeep back!\u201d said several.\nThe crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through. Every one\nseemed greatly excited. I heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit.\n",

        "90": "A sudden chill came over me. There was a loud shriek from a woman\nbehind. I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still,\nfrom which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my\nway back from the edge of the pit. I saw astonishment giving place to\n",

        "93": "the light, it glistened like wet leather.\nTwo large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly. The mass\nthat framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had, one\nmight say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim\n",
        "94": "of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature\nheaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped\nthe edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.\n",
        "95": "Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the\nstrange horror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its\npointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin\nbeneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth,\nthe Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs\nin a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness of\nmovement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth\u2014above\nall, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes\u2014were at once\nvital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous. There was something\nfungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of\nthe tedious movements unspeakably nasty. Even at this first encounter,\n",

It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in,\nbut showing as a little black object against the hot western sun. Now\n",
        "99": "he got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until\nonly his head was visible. Suddenly he vanished, and I could have\nfancied a faint shriek had reached me. I had a momentary impulse to go\nback and help him that my fears overruled.\n",
        "100": "Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep pit and the\nheap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made. Anyone coming\nalong the road from Chobham or Woking would have been amazed at the\nsight\u2014a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more\nstanding in a great irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes, behind\ngates and hedges, saying little to one another and that in short,\nexcited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps of sand. The\nbarrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black against the\nburning sky, and in the sand-pits was a row of deserted vehicles with\ntheir horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground.\n",
        "101": "V.\nTHE HEAT-RAY.\nAfter the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from the cylinder\nin which they had come to the earth from their planet, a kind of\nfascination paralysed my actions. I remained standing knee-deep in the\n",

        "103": "seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand-heaps\nthat hid these new-comers to our earth. Once a leash of thin black\nwhips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was\nimmediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by\njoint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling\nmotion. What could be going on there?\nMost of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups\u2014one a little\ncrowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in the direction of\nChobham. Evidently they shared my mental conflict. There were few near\n",

        "107": "crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard\nnow a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards Chobham\ndispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.\nIt was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I\nsuppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.\n",
        "108": "At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the\nsand-pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the\nstillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken. Vertical\nblack figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and\nadvance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular\ncrescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns. I,\ntoo, on my side began to move towards the pit.\n",
        "109": "Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand-pits,\nand heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad\ntrundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty yards of\nthe pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little\nblack knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.\n",
        "110": "This was the Deputation. There had been a hasty consultation, and since\nthe Martians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms,\nintelligent creatures, it had been resolved to show them, by\napproaching them with signals, that we too were intelligent.\nFlutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to the left.\n",
        "111": "It was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwards I\nlearned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in this\nattempt at communication. This little group had in its advance dragged\ninward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost complete\ncircle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed it at\ndiscreet distances.\nSuddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous\ngreenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove\nup, one after the other, straight into the still air.\n",
        "112": "This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so\nbright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown\ncommon towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken\nabruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after their\ndispersal. At the same time a faint hissing sound became audible.\nBeyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at\nits apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of small vertical\nblack shapes upon the black ground. As the green smoke arose, their\nfaces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished. Then\n",
        "113": "slowly the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud, droning\nnoise. Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a\nbeam of light seemed to flicker out from it.\nForthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to\nanother, sprang from the scattered group of men. It was as if some\n",
        "114": "invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame. It was\nas if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.\nThen, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them staggering and\nfalling, and their supporters turning to run.\n",
        "115": "I stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leaping from\nman to man in that little distant crowd. All I felt was that it was\nsomething very strange. An almost noiseless and blinding flash of\nlight, and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft\nof heat passed over them, pine trees burst into fire, and every dry\nfurze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames. And far away\n",
        "116": "towards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden\nbuildings suddenly set alight.\nIt was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death, this\ninvisible, inevitable sword of heat.

        "117": "squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled. Then it was as if an\ninvisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather\nbetween me and the Martians, and all along a curving line beyond the\nsand-pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something fell with a\ncrash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out\non the common. Forth-with the hissing and humming ceased, and the\n",
        "118": "black, dome-like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.\nAll this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless,\ndumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light. Had that death swept\nthrough a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise.\n",
        "119": "But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me suddenly dark\nand unfamiliar.\nThe undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, except where\nits roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early\nnight. It was dark, and suddenly void of men. Overhead the stars were\nmustering, and in the west the sky was still a pale, bright, almost\ngreenish blue. The tops of the pine trees and the roofs of Horsell came\n",
        "120": "out sharp and black against the western afterglow. The Martians and\ntheir appliances were altogether invisible, save for that thin mast\nupon which their restless mirror wobbled. Patches of bush and isolated\ntrees here and there smoked and glowed still, and the houses towards\nWoking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of\nthe evening air.\n",
        "121": "Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment. The\nlittle group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out\nof existence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed to me, had\nscarcely been broken.\nIt came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless, unprotected,\nand alone. Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from without,\n",
        "122": "came\u2014fear.\nWith an effort I turned and began a stumbling run through the heather.\nThe fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not only of\nthe Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me. Such an\n",

Once I had turned, I did not dare to look back.\nI remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was being played\nwith, that presently, when I was upon the very verge of safety, this\nmysterious death\u2014as swift as the passage of light\u2014would leap after me\nfrom the pit about the cylinder, and strike me down.\nVI.\n",
        "124": "THE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROAD.\nIt is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so\nswiftly and so silently.

        "125": "against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror\nof unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse\nprojects a beam of light. But no one has absolutely proved these\ndetails. However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat is the\nessence of the matter. Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light.\n",

You may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road\nin the gloaming. . . .\n",
        "128": "As yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder had\nopened, though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the\npost office with a special wire to an evening paper.\nAs these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, they found\nlittle knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the spinning\nmirror over the sand-pits, and the newcomers were, no doubt, soon\ninfected by the excitement of the occasion.\nBy half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed, there may have\nbeen a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place, besides\nthose who had left the road to approach the Martians nearer. There were\n",

        "331": "anyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind the outskirts of that\nvillage, fired simultaneously. The sudden near concussion, the last\nclose upon the first, made my heart jump. The monster was already\nraising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the first shell burst six\nyards above the hood.\n",
        "332": "I gave a cry of astonishment. I saw and thought nothing of the other\nfour Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer\nincident. Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the\nbody as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to\ndodge, the fourth shell.\n",
        "333": "The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing. The hood bulged,\nflashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and\nglittering metal.\n\u201cHit!\u201d shouted I, with something between a scream and a cheer.\n",
        "334": "I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me. I could\nhave leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation.\nThe decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did not\nfall over. It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer\n",

        "337": "In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but almost\nscaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream. I saw people\nstruggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting faintly\nabove the seething and roar of the Martian\u2019s collapse.\nFor a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the patent need of\nself-preservation.

The tentacles swayed and struck like\nliving arms, and, save for the helpless purposelessness of these\nmovements, it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for its life\namid the waves.

        "341": "Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly.\nAt that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath until\nmovement was an agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as\nlong as I could. The water was in a tumult about me, and rapidly\ngrowing hotter.\n",
        "342": "When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the hair\nand water from my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling white fog\nthat at first hid the Martians altogether. The noise was deafening.\nThen I saw them dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnified by the mist.\nThey had passed by me, and two were stooping over the frothing,\ntumultuous ruins of their comrade.\n",
        "343": "The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two\nhundred yards from me, the other towards Laleham. The generators of the\nHeat-Rays waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this way and\nthat.\nThe air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of\nnoises\u2014the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling houses,\nthe thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the crackling\nand roaring of fire.

Through the reek\n",
        "345": "I could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out\nof the water through the reeds, like little frogs hurrying through\ngrass from the advance of a man, or running to and fro in utter dismay\non the towing path.\nThen suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leaping towards\nme. The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, and darted out\nflames; the trees changed to fire with a roar. The Ray flickered up and\n",
        "346": "down the towing path, licking off the people who ran this way and that,\nand came down to the water\u2019s edge not fifty yards from where I stood.\nIt swept across the river to Shepperton, and the water in its track\nrose in a boiling weal crested with steam. I turned shoreward.\nIn another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-point had\nrushed upon me. I screamed aloud, and scalded, half blinded, agonised,\n",
        "347": "I staggered through the leaping, hissing water towards the shore. Had\nmy foot stumbled, it would have been the end. I fell helplessly, in\nfull sight of the Martians, upon the broad, bare gravelly spit that\nruns down to mark the angle of the Wey and Thames. I expected nothing\n",
        "348": "but death.\nI have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within a score\nof yards of my head, driving straight into the loose gravel, whirling\nit this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense, and then of\nthe four carrying the debris of their comrade between them, now clear\nand then presently faint through a veil of smoke, receding\ninterminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space of river and\nmeadow. And then, very slowly, I realised that by a miracle I had\nescaped.\n",
        "349": "XIII.\nHOW I FELL IN WITH THE CURATE.\nAfter getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons,\nthe Martians retreated to their original position upon Horsell Common;\nand in their haste, and encumbered with the debris of their smashed\ncompanion, they no doubt overlooked many such a stray and negligible\nvictim as myself. Had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith,\n",
        "350": "there was nothing at that time between them and London but batteries of\ntwelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly have reached the capital\nin advance of the tidings of their approach; as sudden, dreadful, and\ndestructive their advent would have been as the earthquake that\ndestroyed Lisbon a century ago.\nBut they were in no hurry. Cylinder followed cylinder on its\ninterplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them\nreinforcement. And meanwhile the military and naval authorities, now\n",
        "351": "fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists, worked with\nfurious energy. Every minute a fresh gun came into position until,\nbefore twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas on the hilly\nslopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black muzzle.\nAnd through the charred and desolated area\u2014perhaps twenty square miles\naltogether\u2014that encircled the Martian encampment on Horsell Common,\nthrough charred and ruined villages among the green trees, through the\nblackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine\nspinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were\npresently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach. But the Martians\n",
        "352": "now understood our command of artillery and the danger of human\nproximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of either cylinder,\nsave at the price of his life.\nIt would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon\nin going to and fro, transferring everything from the second and third\ncylinders\u2014the second in Addlestone Golf Links and the third at\nPyrford\u2014to their original pit on Horsell Common. Over that, above the\nblackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide,\nstood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast\nfighting-machines and descended into the pit. They were hard at work\n",
        "353": "there far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smoke\nthat rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, and\neven, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom Downs.\nAnd while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their next\nsally, and in front of me Humanity gathered for the battle, I made my\nway with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning\nWeybridge towards London.\nI saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting down-stream;\nand throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it, gained\nit, and so escaped out of that destruction. There were no oars in the\n",
        "354": "boat, but I contrived to paddle, as well as my parboiled hands would\nallow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton, going very\ntediously and continually looking behind me, as you may well\nunderstand. I followed the river, because I considered that the water\ngave me my best chance of escape should these giants return.\nThe hot water from the Martian\u2019s overthrow drifted downstream with me,\nso that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either bank.\n",
        "355": "Once, however, I made out a string of black figures hurrying across the\nmeadows from the direction of Weybridge. Halliford, it seemed, was\ndeserted, and several of the houses facing the river were on fire. It\nwas strange to see the place quite tranquil, quite desolate under the\nhot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads of flame going straight\nup into the heat of the afternoon. Never before had I seen houses\n",
        "356": "burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive crowd. A little\nfarther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing, and a\nline of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay.\nFor a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after the\nviolence I had been through, and so intense the heat upon the water.\n",
        "357": "Then my fears got the better of me again, and I resumed my paddling.\nThe sun scorched my bare back. At last, as the bridge at Walton was\ncoming into sight round the bend, my fever and faintness overcame my\nfears, and I landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down, deadly sick,\namid the long grass. I suppose the time was then about four or five\n",
        "358": "o\u2019clock. I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile without meeting\na soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge. I seem to\nremember talking, wanderingly, to myself during that last spurt. I was\n",
        "359": "also very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk no more water. It\nis a curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; I cannot account for\nit, but my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead worried me excessively.\nI do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probably I\ndozed. I became aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged shirt\n",
        "360": "sleeves, and with his upturned, clean-shaven face staring at a faint\nflickering that danced over the sky. The sky was what is called a\nmackerel sky\u2014rows and rows of faint down-plumes of cloud, just tinted\nwith the midsummer sunset.\nI sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly.\n",
        "361": "\u201cHave you any water?\u201d I asked abruptly.\nHe shook his head.\n\u201cYou have been asking for water for the last hour,\u201d he said.\n",
        "362": "For a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other. I dare say he\nfound me a strange enough figure, naked, save for my water-soaked\ntrousers and socks, scalded, and my face and shoulders blackened by the\nsmoke. His face was a fair weakness, his chin retreated, and his hair\nlay in crisp, almost flaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were\nrather large, pale blue, and blankly staring. He spoke abruptly,\n",
        "363": "looking vacantly away from me.\n\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do these things mean?\u201d\nI stared at him and made no answer.\n",
        "364": "He extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining tone.\n\u201cWhy are these things permitted? What sins have we done?

They\nmoved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a milky mist covered the\nfields and rose to a third of their height.\nAt this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and began\nrunning; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian, and I turned\naside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad\nditch by the side of the road. He looked back, saw what I was doing,\n",

        "456": "But facing that crescent everywhere\u2014at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton,\nEsher, Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the river, and across\nthe flat grass meadows to the north of it, wherever a cluster of trees\nor village houses gave sufficient cover\u2014the guns were waiting. The\nsignal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and\nvanished, and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a\ntense expectation. The Martians had but to advance into the line of\nfire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns\nglittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a\nthunderous fury of battle.\n",
        "457": "No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those vigilant\nminds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle\u2014how much they\nunderstood of us. Did they grasp that we in our millions were\norganized, disciplined, working together? Or did they interpret our\nspurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady\ninvestment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of\nonslaught in a disturbed hive of bees? Did they dream they might\n",

        "459": "pitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare? Would the\nLondoners have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow of their\nmighty province of houses?\nThen, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching and\npeering through the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of\na gun. Another nearer, and then another. And then the Martian beside us\n",
        "460": "raised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy report\nthat made the ground heave. The one towards Staines answered him. There\nwas no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded detonation.\nI was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another that\nI so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber\nup into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury. As I did so a second\n",
        "461": "report followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards\nHounslow. I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such\nevidence of its work. But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with\none solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath.\n",
        "462": "And there had been no crash, no answering explosion. The silence was\nrestored; the minute lengthened to three.\n\u201cWhat has happened?\u201d said the curate, standing up beside me.\n",
        "463": "\u201cHeaven knows!\u201d said I.\nA bat flickered by and vanished. A distant tumult of shouting began and\nceased. I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was now moving\n",

These hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared.\nMoved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there I perceived a\nthird of these cloudy black kopjes had risen.\nEverything had suddenly become very still. Far away to the southeast,\n",
        "466": "marking the quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to one another, and\nthen the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns. But\nthe earthly artillery made no reply.\nNow at the time we could not understand these things, but later I was\nto learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the\ntwilight.

Some fired only\none of these, some two\u2014as in the case of the one we had seen; the one\nat Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time.\nThese canisters smashed on striking the ground\u2014they did not explode\u2014and\nincontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy, inky vapour,\ncoiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud, a gaseous\nhill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country.\n",
        "468": "And the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of its pungent wisps, was\ndeath to all that breathes.\nIt was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that,\nafter the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank\ndown through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather\nliquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the\nvalleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the\ncarbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do. And\nwhere it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the surface\nwould be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and\nmade way for more. The scum was absolutely insoluble, and it is a\n",
        "469": "strange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one could\ndrink without hurt the water from which it had been strained. The\nvapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do. It hung together in\nbanks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving\nreluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist\nand moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust.\n",
        "470": "Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue\nof the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the\nnature of this substance.\nOnce the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black\nsmoke clung so closely to the ground, even before its precipitation,\nthat fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories of high\nhouses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poison\naltogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton.\nThe man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the\nstrangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the church\nspire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its\ninky nothingness. For a day and a half he remained there, weary,\n",
        "471": "starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and against the\nprospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with red roofs,\ngreen trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns,\nouthouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight.\nBut that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed to\nremain until it sank of its own accord into the ground. As a rule the\nMartians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it again\nby wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it.\n",
        "472": "This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the starlight\nfrom the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford, whither we had\nreturned. From there we could see the searchlights on Richmond Hill and\nKingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven the windows rattled,\nand we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put in\nposition there. These continued intermittently for the space of a\nquarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the invisible Martians at\nHampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of the electric light\nvanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow.\n",
        "473": "Then the fourth cylinder fell\u2014a brilliant green meteor\u2014as I learned\nafterwards, in Bushey Park. Before the guns on the Richmond and\nKingston line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far away in\nthe southwest, due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard before the\nblack vapour could overwhelm the gunners.\nSo, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a wasps\u2019\nnest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the\nLondonward country.

By ten o\u2019clock the police organisation, and by\nmidday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency, losing\nshape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in that\nswift liquefaction of the social body.\nAll the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-Eastern people\nat Cannon Street had been warned by midnight on Sunday, and trains were\nbeing filled. People were fighting savagely for standing-room in the\n",

By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes,\n",
        "483": "and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and\nacross the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges in\nits sluggish advance.

        "493": "The man before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and he stopped him\nwith a blow in the face. Then, realising that he was deserted, he\ndodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise, with the\nsturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned now,\nfollowing remotely.\nSuddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong, and\nhe rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again.\n",
        "494": "He would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady\nvery pluckily pulled up and returned to his help.

        "503": "\u201cWe have money,\u201d said the slender woman, and hesitated.\nHer eyes met my brother\u2019s, and her hesitation ended.\n\u201cSo have I,\u201d said my brother.\n",
        "504": "She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold, besides a\nfive-pound note, and suggested that with that they might get upon a\ntrain at St. Albans or New Barnet. My brother thought that was\nhopeless, seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains,\nand broached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and\nthence escaping from the country altogether.\nMrs. Elphinstone\u2014that was the name of the woman in white\u2014would listen\n",

So, designing to cross the Great North Road, they\nwent on towards Barnet, my brother leading the pony to save it as much\nas possible. As the sun crept up the sky the day became excessively\nhot, and under foot a thick, whitish sand grew burning and blinding, so\nthat they travelled only very slowly. The hedges were grey with dust.\n",
        "506": "And as they advanced towards Barnet a tumultuous murmuring grew\nstronger.\nThey began to meet more people. For the most part these were staring\nbefore them, murmuring indistinct questions, jaded, haggard, unclean.\n",

        "508": "As my brother\u2019s party went on towards the crossroads to the south of\nBarnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on\ntheir left, carrying a child and with two other children; and then\npassed a man in dirty black, with a thick stick in one hand and a small\nportmanteau in the other. Then round the corner of the lane, from\nbetween the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the high\nroad, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and driven by a\nsallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust. There were three girls,\nEast End factory girls, and a couple of little children crowded in the\ncart.\n",

He was so fascinated by this and\nby the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for\nanything seaward.

It hit her larboard side and\nglanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, an unfolding\ntorrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear. To the\nwatchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun in their\neyes, it seemed as though she were already among the Martians.\n",

        "587": "But no one heeded that very much. At the sight of the Martian\u2019s\ncollapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, and all the\ncrowding passengers on the steamer\u2019s stern shouted together.

        "589": "a violent thud, a blinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped\nupward. The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, and\nin another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with the\nimpetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of\ncardboard. My brother shouted involuntarily. A boiling tumult of steam\nhid everything again.\n",
        "590": "\u201cTwo!\u201d yelled the captain.\nEveryone was shouting. The whole steamer from end to end rang with\nfrantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the\ncrowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea.\n",
        "591": "The steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding the third\nMartian and the coast altogether. And all this time the boat was\npaddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last\nthe confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black vapour intervened,\nand nothing of the _Thunder Child_ could be made out, nor could the\nthird Martian be seen. But the ironclads to seaward were now quite\nclose and standing in towards shore past the steamboat.\n",
        "592": "The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and the ironclads\nreceded slowly towards the coast, which was hidden still by a marbled\nbank of vapour, part steam, part black gas, eddying and combining in\nthe strangest way. The fleet of refugees was scattering to the\nnortheast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads and the\nsteamboat. After a time, and before they reached the sinking cloud\nbank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly went about and\npassed into the thickening haze of evening southward. The coast grew\n",
        "593": "faint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of clouds that\nwere gathering about the sinking sun.\nThen suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration\nof guns, and a form of black shadows moving. Everyone struggled to the\nrail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west,\nbut nothing was to be distinguished clearly. A mass of smoke rose\n",
        "594": "slanting and barred the face of the sun. The steamboat throbbed on its\nway through an interminable suspense.\nThe sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the\nevening star trembled into sight. It was deep twilight when the captain\n",
        "595": "cried out and pointed. My brother strained his eyes. Something rushed\nup into the sky out of the greyness\u2014rushed slantingly upward and very\nswiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western\nsky; something flat and broad, and very large, that swept round in a\nvast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, and vanished again into the grey\nmystery of the night. And as it flew it rained down darkness upon the\nland.\n",

There I will\nresume. We stopped there all Sunday night and all the next day\u2014the day\nof the panic\u2014in a little island of daylight, cut off by the Black Smoke\nfrom the rest of the world.

When he followed me\nthither, I went to a box room at the top of the house and, in order to\nbe alone with my aching miseries, locked myself in.\nWe were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all that day and the\nmorning of the next. There were signs of people in the next house on\n",

We saw nothing of them next day. The Black Smoke\ndrifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer\nand nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house\nthat hid us.\n",
        "603": "A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff with a\njet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed all the\nwindows it touched, and scalded the curate\u2019s hand as he fled out of the\nfront room. When at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked\nout again, the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had\npassed over it. Looking towards the river, we were astonished to see an\nunaccountable redness mingling with the black of the scorched meadows.\n",
        "604": "For a time we did not see how this change affected our position, save\nthat we were relieved of our fear of the Black Smoke. But later I\nperceived that we were no longer hemmed in, that now we might get away.\nSo soon as I realised that the way of escape was open, my dream of\naction returned. But the curate was lethargic, unreasonable.\n",

Up the\nhill Richmond town was burning briskly; outside the town of Richmond\nthere was no trace of the Black Smoke.\nThen suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number of people running,\nand the upperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in sight over\nthe housetops, not a hundred yards away from us. We stood aghast at our\n",

The curate I left in the shed, but\nhe came hurrying after me.\n",
        "615": "That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did. For it was\nmanifest the Martians were about us. No sooner had the curate overtaken\nme than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen before or\nanother, far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew Lodge.\n",
        "616": "Four or five little black figures hurried before it across the\ngreen-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian\npursued them. In three strides he was among them, and they ran\nradiating from his feet in all directions. He used no Heat-Ray to\ndestroy them, but picked them up one by one. Apparently he tossed them\n",
        "617": "into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much as a\nworkman\u2019s basket hangs over his shoulder.\nIt was the first time I realised that the Martians might have any other\npurpose than destruction with defeated humanity. We stood for a moment\npetrified, then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a walled\ngarden, fell into, rather than found, a fortunate ditch, and lay there,\nscarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were out.\n",
        "618": "I suppose it was nearly eleven o\u2019clock before we gathered courage to\nstart again, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along\nhedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly through the\ndarkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians, who\nseemed to be all about us. In one place we blundered upon a scorched\nand blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered\ndead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with\ntheir legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fifty feet,\nperhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages.\nSheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place was silent and\ndeserted. Here we happened on no dead, though the night was too dark\n",
        "619": "for us to see into the side roads of the place. In Sheen my companion\nsuddenly complained of faintness and thirst, and we decided to try one\nof the houses.\nThe first house we entered, after a little difficulty with the window,\nwas a small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable left in\nthe place but some mouldy cheese. There was, however, water to drink;\n",
        "620": "and I took a hatchet, which promised to be useful in our next\nhouse-breaking.\nWe then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake. Here\nthere stood a white house within a walled garden, and in the pantry of\nthis domicile we found a store of food\u2014two loaves of bread in a pan, an\nuncooked steak, and the half of a ham. I give this catalogue so\n",
        "621": "precisely because, as it happened, we were destined to subsist upon\nthis store for the next fortnight. Bottled beer stood under a shelf,\nand there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces. This\npantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and in this was firewood;\nthere was also a cupboard, in which we found nearly a dozen of\nburgundy, tinned soups and salmon, and two tins of biscuits.\n",
        "622": "We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark\u2014for we dared not strike a\nlight\u2014and ate bread and ham, and drank beer out of the same bottle. The\ncurate, who was still timorous and restless, was now, oddly enough, for\npushing on, and I was urging him to keep up his strength by eating when\nthe thing happened that was to imprison us.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be midnight yet,\u201d I said, and then came a blinding glare of\nvivid green light. Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly\n",
        "623": "visible in green and black, and vanished again. And then followed such\na concussion as I have never heard before or since. So close on the\nheels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me, a clash\nof glass, a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the\nplaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude of\nfragments upon our heads. I was knocked headlong across the floor\n",
        "624": "against the oven handle and stunned. I was insensible for a long time,\nthe curate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness again, and\nhe, with a face wet, as I found afterwards, with blood from a cut\nforehead, was dabbing water over me.\nFor some time I could not recollect what had happened. Then things came\n",
        "625": "to me slowly. A bruise on my temple asserted itself.\n\u201cAre you better?\u201d asked the curate in a whisper.\nAt last I answered him. I sat up.\n",
        "626": "\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he said. \u201cThe floor is covered with smashed crockery from\nthe dresser. You can\u2019t possibly move without making a noise, and I\nfancy _they_ are outside.\u201d\n",
        "627": "We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each other\nbreathing. Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near us,\nsome plaster or broken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound.\nOutside and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle.\n",
        "628": "\u201cThat!\u201d said the curate, when presently it happened again.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cBut what is it?\u201d\n\u201cA Martian!\u201d said the curate.\n",
        "629": "I listened again.\n\u201cIt was not like the Heat-Ray,\u201d I said, and for a time I was inclined\nto think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled against the\nhouse, as I had seen one stumble against the tower of Shepperton\nChurch.\nOur situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or\nfour hours, until the dawn came, we scarcely moved. And then the light\n",
        "630": "filtered in, not through the window, which remained black, but through\na triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the\nwall behind us. The interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for the\nfirst time.\nThe window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould, which flowed\nover the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet.\n",
        "631": "Outside, the soil was banked high against the house. At the top of the\nwindow frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe. The floor was littered\nwith smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the house was\nbroken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was evident the\ngreater part of the house had collapsed. Contrasting vividly with this\n",
        "632": "ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion, pale green, and with\na number of copper and tin vessels below it, the wallpaper imitating\nblue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering\nfrom the walls above the kitchen range.\nAs the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the wall the body\nof a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over the still glowing\ncylinder. At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as possible\nout of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery.\n",
        "633": "Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind.\n\u201cThe fifth cylinder,\u201d I whispered, \u201cthe fifth shot from Mars, has\nstruck this house and buried us under the ruins!\u201d\nFor a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:\n\u201cGod have mercy upon us!\u201d\n",
        "634": "I heard him presently whimpering to himself.\nSave for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for my part\nscarce dared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of\nthe kitchen door. I could just see the curate\u2019s face, a dim, oval\nshape, and his collar and cuffs. Outside there began a metallic\n",

These noises, for\nthe most part problematical, continued intermittently, and seemed if\nanything to increase in number as time wore on. Presently a measured\nthudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the\nvessels in the pantry ring and shift, began and continued. Once the\n",

        "639": "After eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I must have dozed\nagain, for when presently I looked round I was alone. The thudding\nvibration continued with wearisome persistence. I whispered for the\ncurate several times, and at last felt my way to the door of the\nkitchen. It was still daylight, and I perceived him across the room,\n",
        "640": "lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the Martians.\nHis shoulders were hunched, so that his head was hidden from me.\nI could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine shed;\nand the place rocked with that beating thud. Through the aperture in\n",
        "641": "the wall I could see the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm\nblue of a tranquil evening sky. For a minute or so I remained watching\nthe curate, and then I advanced, crouching and stepping with extreme\ncare amid the broken crockery that littered the floor.\nI touched the curate\u2019s leg, and he started so violently that a mass of\nplaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact. I\n",
        "642": "gripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we\ncrouched motionless. Then I turned to see how much of our rampart\nremained. The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open\nin the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across a beam I was\nable to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet\nsuburban roadway. Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld.\n",
        "643": "The fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house\nwe had first visited. The building had vanished, completely smashed,\npulverised, and dispersed by the blow. The cylinder lay now far beneath\nthe original foundations\u2014deep in a hole, already vastly larger than the\npit I had looked into at Woking. The earth all round it had splashed\n",

It had behaved\nexactly like mud under the violent blow of a hammer. Our house had\ncollapsed backward; the front portion, even on the ground floor, had\nbeen destroyed completely; by a chance the kitchen and scullery had\nescaped, and stood buried now under soil and ruins, closed in by tons\nof earth on every side save towards the cylinder. Over that aspect we\n",

At first I scarcely noticed the\n",
        "646": "pit and the cylinder, although it has been convenient to describe them\nfirst, on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism I saw busy\nin the excavation, and on account of the strange creatures that were\ncrawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it.\nThe mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first. It was one\nof those complicated fabrics that have since been called\nhandling-machines, and the study of which has already given such an\nenormous impetus to terrestrial invention. As it dawned upon me first,\n",
        "647": "it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed, agile legs,\nand with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars, and reaching\nand clutching tentacles about its body. Most of its arms were\nretracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of\nrods, plates, and bars which lined the covering and apparently\nstrengthened the walls of the cylinder. These, as it extracted them,\nwere lifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it.\n",
        "648": "Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I did not\nsee it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter. The\nfighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary\npitch, but nothing to compare with this. People who have never seen\nthese structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or\nthe imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon,\nscarcely realise that living quality.\n",
        "649": "I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets to\ngive a consecutive account of the war. The artist had evidently made a\nhasty study of one of the fighting-machines, and there his knowledge\nended. He presented them as tilted, stiff tripods, without either\nflexibility or subtlety, and with an altogether misleading monotony of\neffect. The pamphlet containing these renderings had a considerable\n",
        "650": "vogue, and I mention them here simply to warn the reader against the\nimpression they may have created. They were no more like the Martians I\nsaw in action than a Dutch doll is like a human being. To my mind, the\npamphlet would have been much better without them.\n",
        "651": "At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as a machine,\nbut as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the\ncontrolling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements\nseeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab\u2019s cerebral portion. But\nthen I perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny, leathery\nintegument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond, and the true\nnature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me. With that realisation\nmy interest shifted to those other creatures, the real Martians.\n",
        "652": "Already I had had a transient impression of these, and the first nausea\nno longer obscured my observation. Moreover, I was concealed and\nmotionless, and under no urgency of action.\nThey were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible to\nconceive. They were huge round bodies\u2014or, rather, heads\u2014about four feet\n",
        "653": "in diameter, each body having in front of it a face. This face had no\nnostrils\u2014indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any sense of\nsmell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes, and just\nbeneath this a kind of fleshy beak. In the back of this head or body\u2014I\nscarcely know how to speak of it\u2014was the single tight tympanic surface,\nsince known to be anatomically an ear, though it must have been almost\nuseless in our dense air. In a group round the mouth were sixteen\n",
        "654": "slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two bunches of eight\neach. These bunches have since been named rather aptly, by that\ndistinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the _hands_. Even as I saw\nthese Martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring to\nraise themselves on these hands, but of course, with the increased\nweight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible. There is reason\n",
        "655": "to suppose that on Mars they may have progressed upon them with some\nfacility.\nThe internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since shown,\nwas almost equally simple. The greater part of the structure was the\nbrain, sending enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile tentacles.\n",
        "656": "Besides this were the bulky lungs, into which the mouth opened, and the\nheart and its vessels. The pulmonary distress caused by the denser\natmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in\nthe convulsive movements of the outer skin.\nAnd this was the sum of the Martian organs. Strange as it may seem to a\n",

They did not eat, much less\ndigest. Instead, they took the fresh, living blood of other creatures,\n",
        "658": "and _injected_ it into their own veins. I have myself seen this being\ndone, as I shall mention in its place. But, squeamish as I may seem, I\ncannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure even to\ncontinue watching. Let it suffice to say, blood obtained from a still\n",

Our bodies are\n",
        "660": "half made up of glands and tubes and organs, occupied in turning\nheterogeneous food into blood. The digestive processes and their\nreaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our minds.\nMen go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers, or\nsound gastric glands.

At any rate, the seeds\nwhich the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them\ngave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths. Only that known\npopularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition\nwith terrestrial forms. The red creeper was quite a transitory growth,\n",

Almost all the joints of the\nmachinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over\nsmall but beautifully curved friction bearings. And while upon this\nmatter of detail, it is remarkable that the long leverages of their\nmachines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of\nthe disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn\nclosely and powerfully together when traversed by a current of\nelectricity. In this way the curious parallelism to animal motions,\n",
        "680": "which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder, was\nattained. Such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machine\nwhich, on my first peeping out of the slit, I watched unpacking the\ncylinder. It seemed infinitely more alive than the actual Martians\nlying beyond it in the sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual\ntentacles, and moving feebly after their vast journey across space.\n",

I turned to a scowling face,\nand silent, eloquent lips. He wanted the slit, which permitted only one\nof us to peep through; and so I had to forego watching them for a time\nwhile he enjoyed that privilege.\n",
        "682": "When I looked again, the busy handling-machine had already put together\nseveral of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the cylinder\ninto a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own; and down on\nthe left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view, emitting\njets of green vapour and working its way round the pit, excavating and\nembanking in a methodical and discriminating manner. This it was which\nhad caused the regular beating noise, and the rhythmic shocks that had\nkept our ruinous refuge quivering. It piped and whistled as it worked.\nSo far as I could see, the thing was without a directing Martian at\nall.\n",

At Halliford I had already come to hate the\ncurate\u2019s trick of helpless exclamation, his stupid rigidity of mind.\n",
        "686": "His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made to think\nout a line of action, and drove me at times, thus pent up and\nintensified, almost to the verge of craziness. He was as lacking in\nrestraint as a silly woman.

He ate\nmore than I did, and it was in vain I pointed out that our only chance\nof life was to stop in the house until the Martians had done with their\npit, that in that long patience a time might presently come when we\nshould need food. He ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at long\nintervals. He slept little.\n",
        "688": "As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any consideration so\nintensified our distress and danger that I had, much as I loathed doing\nit, to resort to threats, and at last to blows. That brought him to\nreason for a time. But he was one of those weak creatures, void of\npride, timorous, an\u00e6mic, hateful souls, full of shifty cunning, who\nface neither God nor man, who face not even themselves.\n",
        "689": "It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things, but I set\nthem down that my story may lack nothing. Those who have escaped the\ndark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality, my flash of\nrage in our final tragedy, easy enough to blame; for they know what is\nwrong as well as any, but not what is possible to tortured men. But\nthose who have been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to\nelemental things, will have a wider charity.\n",

With two spatulate hands the handling-machine was\ndigging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped receptacle\nabove, while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed\nrusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine.\nAnother steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a\nribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me by the\nmound of bluish dust. From this unseen receiver a little thread of\n",

I was sitting below, huddled up, listening with all my\n",
        "695": "ears. He made a sudden movement backward, and I, fearful that we were\nobserved, crouched in a spasm of terror. He came sliding down the\nrubbish and crept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate,\ngesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic. His gesture\n",
        "696": "suggested a resignation of the slit, and after a little while my\ncuriosity gave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and\nclambered up to it.

And then, amid the clangour of the machinery, came a\ndrifting suspicion of human voices, that I entertained at first only to\ndismiss.\n",
        "698": "I crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfying myself\nnow for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a Martian. As\nthe green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam of his integument\nand the brightness of his eyes.

        "701": "I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands over my\nears, and bolted into the scullery. The curate, who had been crouching\nsilently with his arms over his head, looked up as I passed, cried out\nquite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after me.\nThat night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between our horror\nand the terrible fascination this peeping had, although I felt an\nurgent need of action I tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape;\nbut afterwards, during the second day, I was able to consider our\nposition with great clearness. The curate, I found, was quite incapable\n",
        "702": "of discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed him of all\nvestiges of reason or forethought. Practically he had already sunk to\nthe level of an animal.

        "704": "weighed very carefully the possibility of our digging a way out in a\ndirection away from the pit, but the chances of our emerging within\nsight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great. And\nI should have had to do all the digging myself. The curate would\ncertainly have failed me.\n",
        "705": "It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right, that I saw the\nlad killed. It was the only occasion on which I actually saw the\nMartians feed. After that experience I avoided the hole in the wall for\nthe better part of a day. I went into the scullery, removed the door,\n",

I lost heart, and lay\ndown on the scullery floor for a long time, having no spirit even to\nmove. And after that I abandoned altogether the idea of escaping by\nexcavation.\n",
        "707": "It says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me that at\nfirst I entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought about\nby their overthrow through any human effort.

Except\nfor the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and patches of\nwhite moonlight the pit was in darkness, and, except for the clinking\nof the handling-machine, quite still.

        "959": "I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately.\nThe door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as I\napproached.\nIt slammed again. The curtains of my study fluttered out of the open\n",

        "967": "caught her in my arms.\nX.\nTHE EPILOGUE.\n",
        "968": "I cannot but regret, now that I am concluding my story, how little I am\nable to contribute to the discussion of the many debatable questions\nwhich are still unsettled. In one respect I shall certainly provoke\ncriticism. My particular province is speculative philosophy. My\nknowledge of comparative physiology is confined to a book or two, but\nit seems to me that Carver\u2019s suggestions as to the reason of the rapid\ndeath of the Martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as a\nproven conclusion. I have assumed that in the body of my narrative.\n",
        "969": "At any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians that were examined after\nthe war, no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial species\nwere found. That they did not bury any of their dead, and the reckless\nslaughter they perpetrated, point also to an entire ignorance of the\nputrefactive process. But probable as this seems, it is by no means a\nproven conclusion.\n",
        "970": "Neither is the composition of the Black Smoke known, which the Martians\nused with such deadly effect, and the generator of the Heat-Rays\nremains a puzzle. The terrible disasters at the Ealing and South\nKensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further\ninvestigations upon the latter. Spectrum analysis of the black powder\npoints unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a\nbrilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is possible that it\ncombines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadly\neffect upon some constituent in the blood. But such unproven\n",
        "971": "speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader, to\nwhom this story is addressed. None of the brown scum that drifted down\nthe Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined at the\ntime, and now none is forthcoming.\nThe results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far as the\nprowling dogs had left such an examination possible, I have already\ngiven.

        "973": "planet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to opposition I,\nfor one, anticipate a renewal of their adventure. In any case, we\nshould be prepared. It seems to me that it should be possible to define\nthe position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, to keep a\nsustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate the\narrival of the next attack.\n",
        "974": "In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillery\nbefore it was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emerge, or they\nmight be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw opened. It\nseems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure of\ntheir first surprise. Possibly they see it in the same light.\nLessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the Martians\nhave actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet Venus.\n",
        "975": "Seven months ago now, Venus and Mars were in alignment with the sun;\nthat is to say, Mars was in opposition from the point of view of an\nobserver on Venus. Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking\nappeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and almost\nsimultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was\ndetected upon a photograph of the Martian disk. One needs to see the\ndrawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their\nremarkable resemblance in character.\n",
        "976": "At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views of\nthe human future must be greatly modified by these events. We have\nlearned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a\nsecure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen good\nor evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space. It may be that in\nthe larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not\nwithout its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene\nconfidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of\ndecadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and\nit has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of\nmankind. It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians have\n",
        "977": "watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson,\nand that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement. Be\nthat as it may, for many years yet there will certainly be no\nrelaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and those fiery\ndarts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with them as they fall\nan unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.\nThe broadening of men\u2019s views that has resulted can scarcely be\nexaggerated. Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion\n",
        "978": "that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty\nsurface of our minute sphere. Now we see further. If the Martians can\nreach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible\nfor men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth\nuninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread of life\nthat has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet\nwithin its toils.\nDim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of life\nspreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system\nthroughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space. But that is a\n",
        "979": "remote dream. It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction of the\nMartians is only a reprieve. To them, and not to us, perhaps, is the\nfuture ordained.\n",
        "980": "I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding\nsense of doubt and insecurity in my mind. I sit in my study writing by\nlamplight, and suddenly I see again the healing valley below set with\nwrithing flames, and feel the house behind and about me empty and\ndesolate. I go out into the Byfleet Road, and vehicles pass me, a\nbutcher boy in a cart, a cabful of visitors, a workman on a bicycle,\nchildren going to school, and suddenly they become vague and unreal,\nand I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot, brooding\nsilence. Of a night I see the black powder darkening the silent\n",
        "981": "streets, and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they rise\nupon me tattered and dog-bitten. They gibber and grow fiercer, paler,\nuglier, mad distortions of humanity at last, and I wake, cold and\nwretched, in the darkness of the night.\nI go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet Street and the\nStrand, and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the\npast, haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched, going\nto and fro, phantasms in a dead city, the mockery of life in a\ngalvanised body. And strange, too, it is to stand on Primrose Hill, as\n",
        "982": "I did but a day before writing this last chapter, to see the great\nprovince of houses, dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and\nmist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to see the people\nwalking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill, to see the\nsight-seers about the Martian machine that stands there still, to hear\nthe tumult of playing children, and to recall the time when I saw it\nall bright and clear-cut, hard and silent, under the dawn of that last\ngreat day. . . .\nAnd strangest of all is it to hold my wife\u2019s hand again, and to think\nthat I have counted her, and that she has counted me, among the dead.\n"
