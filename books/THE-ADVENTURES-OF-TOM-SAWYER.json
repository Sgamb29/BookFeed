Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an\nindividual\u2014he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom\nI knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.\nThe odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and\nslaves in the West at the period of this story\u2014that is to say, thirty or\nforty years ago.\n",
        "20": "Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and\ngirls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,\nfor part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what\nthey once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked,\nand what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.\nTHE AUTHOR.\nHARTFORD, 1876.\n",

        "22": "No answer.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!\u201d\nNo answer.\n",
        "23": "The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the\nroom; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or\nnever looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were\nher state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for \u201cstyle,\u201d not\nservice\u2014she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.\nShe looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but\nstill loud enough for the furniture to hear:\n\u201cWell, I lay if I get hold of you I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\nShe did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching\nunder the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the\npunches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.\n",
        "24": "\u201cI never did see the beat of that boy!\u201d\nShe went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the\ntomato vines and \u201cjimpson\u201d weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So\nshe lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:\n\u201cY-o-u-u TOM!\u201d\n",
        "25": "There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize\na small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.\n\u201cThere! I might \u2019a\u2019 thought of that closet. What you been doing in\nthere?\u201d\n",
        "26": "\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cNothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that\ntruck?\u201d\n",
        "27": "\u201cI don\u2019t know, aunt.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I know. It\u2019s jam\u2014that\u2019s what it is. Forty times I\u2019ve said if you\ndidn\u2019t let that jam alone I\u2019d skin you. Hand me that switch.\u201d\n",
        "28": "The switch hovered in the air\u2014the peril was desperate\u2014\n\u201cMy! Look behind you, aunt!\u201d\nThe old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.\nThe lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and\ndisappeared over it.\n",
        "29": "His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle\nlaugh.\n\u201cHang the boy, can\u2019t I never learn anything? Ain\u2019t he played me tricks\nenough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old\n",
        "30": "fools is the biggest fools there is. Can\u2019t learn an old dog new tricks,\nas the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,\nand how is a body to know what\u2019s coming? He \u2019pears to know just how long\n",
        "31": "he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make\nout to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it\u2019s all down again and\nI can\u2019t hit him a lick. I ain\u2019t doing my duty by that boy, and that\u2019s\nthe Lord\u2019s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as\nthe Good Book says. I\u2019m a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I\n",
        "32": "know. He\u2019s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he\u2019s my own dead\nsister\u2019s boy, poor thing, and I ain\u2019t got the heart to lash him,\nsomehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and\nevery time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is\n",
        "33": "born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says,\nand I reckon it\u2019s so. He\u2019ll play hookey this evening,[*] and I\u2019ll just\nbe obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him. It\u2019s mighty hard\nto make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he\nhates work more than he hates anything else, and I\u2019ve _got_ to do some\nof my duty by him, or I\u2019ll be the ruination of the child.\u201d\n",
        "34": "[*] Southwestern for \u201cafternoon\u201d\nTom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home\nbarely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day\u2019s wood\nand split the kindlings before supper\u2014at least he was there in time\nto tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.\nTom\u2019s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through\nwith his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,\nand had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.\n",
        "35": "While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity\noffered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and\nvery deep\u2014for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like\nmany other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she\nwas endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she\nloved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low\ncunning. Said she:\n\u201cTom, it was middling warm in school, warn\u2019t it?\u201d\n",
        "36": "\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d\n\u201cPowerful warm, warn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d\n",
        "37": "\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?\u201d\nA bit of a scare shot through Tom\u2014a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He\nsearched Aunt Polly\u2019s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:\n",
        "38": "\u201cNo\u2019m\u2014well, not very much.\u201d\nThe old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom\u2019s shirt, and said:\n\u201cBut you ain\u2019t too warm now, though.\u201d And it flattered her to reflect\nthat she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing\nthat that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew\n",
        "39": "where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:\n\u201cSome of us pumped on our heads\u2014mine\u2019s damp yet. See?\u201d\nAunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of\ncircumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new\n",
        "40": "inspiration:\n\u201cTom, you didn\u2019t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to\npump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!\u201d\nThe trouble vanished out of Tom\u2019s face. He opened his jacket. His shirt\ncollar was securely sewed.\n",
        "41": "\u201cBother! Well, go \u2019long with you. I\u2019d made sure you\u2019d played hookey\nand been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you\u2019re a kind of a\nsinged cat, as the saying is\u2014better\u2019n you look. _This_ time.\u201d\n",
        "42": "She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom\nhad stumbled into obedient conduct for once.\nBut Sidney said:\n\u201cWell, now, if I didn\u2019t think you sewed his collar with white thread,\nbut it\u2019s black.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, I did sew it with white! Tom!\u201d\n",
        "43": "But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:\n\u201cSiddy, I\u2019ll lick you for that.\u201d\nIn a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into\nthe lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them\u2014one needle\ncarried white thread and the other black. He said:\n",
        "44": "\u201cShe\u2019d never noticed if it hadn\u2019t been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes\nshe sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to\ngee-miny she\u2019d stick to one or t\u2019other\u2014I can\u2019t keep the run of \u2019em. But\n",
        "45": "I bet you I\u2019ll lam Sid for that. I\u2019ll learn him!\u201d\nHe was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well\nthough\u2014and loathed him.\n",
        "46": "Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not\nbecause his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a\nman\u2019s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore\nthem down and drove them out of his mind for the time\u2014just as men\u2019s\nmisfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new\ninterest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired\nfrom a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It\n",
        "47": "consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,\nproduced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short\nintervals in the midst of the music\u2014the reader probably remembers how to\ndo it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him\nthe knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of\nharmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer\nfeels who has discovered a new planet\u2014no doubt, as far as strong, deep,\nunalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the\nastronomer.\n",
        "48": "The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom\nchecked his whistle. A stranger was before him\u2014a boy a shade larger\nthan himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an impressive\n",
        "49": "curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy\nwas well dressed, too\u2014well dressed on a week-day. This was simply\nastounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth\n",
        "50": "roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes\non\u2014and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of\nribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom\u2019s vitals. The\n",
        "51": "more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose\nat his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to\nhim to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved\u2014but only\nsidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the\ntime. Finally Tom said:\n\u201cI can lick you!\u201d\n",
        "52": "\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I can do it.\u201d\n\u201cNo you can\u2019t, either.\u201d\n",

His head nodded, and little by little his chin\ndescended and touched the enemy, who seized it.

Then there was a wild yelp of agony\nand the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so\ndid the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew\ndown the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the\nhome-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was\nbut a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of\nlight. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang\ninto its master\u2019s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of\ndistress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.\n",
        "205": "By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with\nsuppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.\nThe discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all\npossibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest\nsentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of\nunholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson\nhad said a rarely facetious thing.

Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented\nflesh-colored \u201ctights\u201d very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and\nhad a circus\u2014with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest\npost to his neighbor.\n",

In\none place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a\nmultitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of\na man\u2019s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and\npresently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into\nit.
