        "4": "\u201cWhat is, _mon ami_?\u201d asked Poirot placidly, from the depths of\nhis comfortable chair.\n\u201cDeduce, Poirot, from the following facts! Here is a young lady,\n",

        "8": "\u201cAs usual, your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism.\nThat is Miss Mary Marvell, the film star. She is being followed by\na bevy of admirers who have recognized her. And, _en passant_, my\n",
        "9": "dear Hastings, she is quite aware of the fact!\u201d\nI laughed.\n\u201cSo all is explained! But you get no marks for that, Poirot. It\n",

        "12": "\u201cShe looks so different,\u201d I replied rather feebly.\n\u201cAh! _Sacr\u00e9_!\u201d cried Poirot. \u201cIs it that you expect her to promenade\nherself in the streets of London in a cowboy hat, or with bare\nfeet, and a bunch of curls, as an Irish colleen? Always with you\n",
        "13": "it is the non-essentials! Remember the case of the dancer, Valerie\nSaintclair.\u201d\nI shrugged my shoulders, slightly annoyed.\n",

        "19": "\u201cWhat did I tell you? That is Miss Marvell.\u201d\nAs usual, Poirot was right. After a short interval, the American\nfilm star was ushered in, and we rose to our feet.\n",
        "20": "Mary Marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on\nthe screen. She had only lately arrived in England in company with\nher husband, Gregory B. Rolf, also a film actor. Their marriage\nhad taken place about a year ago in the States and this was their\nfirst visit to England. They had been given a great reception.\n",
        "21": "Every one was prepared to go mad over Mary Marvell, her wonderful\nclothes, her furs, her jewels, above all one jewel, the great\ndiamond which had been nicknamed, to match its owner, \u201cthe Western\nStar.\u201d Much, true and untrue, had been written about this famous\nstone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of\nfifty thousand pounds.\nAll these details passed rapidly through my mind as I joined with\nPoirot in greeting our fair client.\n",
        "22": "Miss Marvell was small and slender, very fair and girlish-looking,\nwith the wide innocent blue eyes of a child.\nPoirot drew forward a chair for her, and she commenced talking at\nonce.\n\u201cYou will probably think me very foolish, Monsieur Poirot, but Lord\nCronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up\nthe mystery of his nephew\u2019s death, and I felt that I just must have\nyour advice. I dare say it\u2019s only a silly hoax\u2014Gregory says so\u2014but\n",
        "23": "it\u2019s just worrying me to death.\u201d\nShe paused for breath. Poirot beamed encouragement.\n\u201cProceed, Madame. You comprehend, I am still in the dark.\u201d\n",
        "24": "\u201cIt\u2019s these letters.\u201d Miss Marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew\nout three envelopes which she handed to Poirot.\nThe latter scrutinized them closely.\n",
        "25": "\u201cCheap paper\u2014the name and address carefully printed. Let us see\nthe inside.\u201d He drew out the enclosure.\nI had joined him, and was leaning over his shoulder. The writing\n",
        "26": "consisted of a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope.\nIt ran as follows:\n\u201cThe great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return\nwhence it came.\u201d\nThe second letter was couched in precisely the same terms, but the\nthird was more explicit:\n\u201cYou have been warned. You have not obeyed. Now the diamond will\n",
        "27": "be taken from you. At the full of the moon, the two diamonds which\nare the left and right eye of the god shall return. So it is\nwritten.\u201d\n",
        "28": "\u201cThe first letter I treated as a joke,\u201d explained Miss Marvell.\n\u201cWhen I got the second, I began to wonder. The third one came\nyesterday, and it seemed to me that, after all, the matter might\nbe more serious than I had imagined.\u201d\n",
        "29": "\u201cI see they did not come by post, these letters.\u201d\n\u201cNo; they were left by hand\u2014by a _Chinaman._ That is what frightens\nme.\u201d\n",
        "30": "\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it was from a Chink in San Francisco that Gregory bought\nthe stone three years ago.\u201d\n\u201cI see, madame, that you believe the diamond referred to to be\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2018The Western Star,\u2019\u201d finished Miss Marvell. \u201cThat\u2019s so. At the\n",
        "31": "time, Gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the\nstone, but the Chink wasn\u2019t handing out any information. Gregory\nsays he seemed just scared to death, and in a mortal hurry to get\nrid of the thing. He only asked about a tenth of its value. It was\nGreg\u2019s wedding present to me.\u201d\n",
        "32": "Poirot nodded thoughtfully.\n\u201cThe story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism. And yet\u2014who\nknows? I pray of you, Hastings, hand me my little almanac.\u201d\n",
        "33": "I complied.\n\u201c_Voyons!_\u201d said Poirot, turning the leaves.\n\u201cWhen is the date of the full moon? Ah, Friday next. That is in\n",
        "34": "three days\u2019 time. _Eh bien_, madame, you seek my advice\u2014I give it\nto you. This _belle histoire_ may be a hoax\u2014but it may not!\nTherefore I counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until\nafter Friday next. Then we can take what steps we please.\u201d\n",
        "35": "A slight cloud passed over the actress\u2019s face, and she replied\nconstrainedly:\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\u201cYou have it with you\u2014_hein_?\u201d Poirot was watching her narrowly.\nThe girl hesitated a moment, then slipped her hand into the bosom\nof her gown, drawing out a long thin chain. She leaned forward,\n",
        "36": "unclosing her hand. In the palm, a stone of white fire, exquisitely\nset in platinum, lay and winked at us solemnly.\nPoirot drew in his breath with a long hiss.\n",
        "37": "\u201c_\u00c9patant!_\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou permit, madame?\u201d He took the jewel\nin his own hand and scrutinized it keenly, then restored it to her\nwith a little bow. \u201cA magnificent stone\u2014without a flaw. Ah, _cent\ntonnerres!_ and you carry it about with you, _comme \u00e7a_!\u201d\n",
        "38": "\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m very careful really, Monsieur Poirot. As a rule it\u2019s\nlocked up in my jewel-case, and left in the hotel safe deposit.\nWe\u2019re staying at the _Magnificent_, you know. I just brought it\n",
        "39": "along to-day for you to see.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you will leave it with me, _n\u2019est-ce pas_? You will be advised\nby Papa Poirot?\u201d\n",
        "40": "\u201cWell, you see, it\u2019s this way, Monsieur Poirot. On Friday we\u2019re\ngoing down to Yardly Chase to spend a few days with Lord and Lady\nYardly.\u201d\nHer words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind. Some\n",
        "41": "gossip\u2014what was it now? A few years ago Lord and Lady Yardly had\npaid a visit to the States, rumour had it that his lordship had\nrather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady\nfriends\u2014but surely there was something more, some gossip which\ncoupled Lady Yardly\u2019s name with that of a \u201cmovie\u201d star in\nCalifornia\u2014why! it came to me in a flash\u2014of course it was none\nother than Gregory B. Rolf.\n",
        "42": "\u201cI\u2019ll let you into a little secret, Monsieur Poirot,\u201d Miss Marvell\nwas continuing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a deal on with Lord Yardly. There\u2019s some\nchance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral\npile.\u201d\n\u201cAt Yardly Chase?\u201d I cried, interested. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s one of the show\n",
        "43": "places of England.\u201d\nMiss Marvell nodded.\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s the real old feudal stuff all right. But he wants a\n",
        "44": "pretty stiff price, and of course I don\u2019t know yet whether the deal\nwill go through, but Greg and I always like to combine business\nwith pleasure.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014I demand pardon if I am dense, madame\u2014surely it is possible\nto visit Yardly Chase without taking the diamond with you?\u201d\nA shrewd, hard look came into Miss Marvell\u2019s eyes which belied\ntheir childlike appearance. She looked suddenly a good deal older.\n",
        "45": "\u201cI want to wear it down there.\u201d\n\u201cSurely\u201d I said suddenly, \u201cthere are some very famous jewels in\nthe Yardly collection, a large diamond amongst them?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d said Miss Marvell briefly.\n",
        "46": "I heard Poirot murmur beneath his breath: \u201cAh, _c\u2019est comme \u00e7a_!\u201d\nThen he said aloud, with his usual uncanny luck in hitting the\nbull\u2019s-eye (he dignifies it by the name of psychology): \u201cThen you\nare without doubt already acquainted with Lady Yardly, or perhaps\nyour husband is?\u201d\n\u201cGregory knew her when she was out West three years ago,\u201d said Miss\nMarvell.

        "47": "either of you ever see _Society Gossip_?\u201d\nWe both pleaded guilty rather shamefacedly.\n\u201cI ask because in this week\u2019s number there is an article on famous\njewels, and it\u2019s really very curious\u2014\u2014\u201d She broke off.\n",
        "48": "I rose, went to the table at the other side of the room and returned\nwith the paper in question in my hand. She took it from me, found\nthe article, and began to read aloud:\n\u201c. . . Amongst other famous stones may be included the Star of the\nEast, a diamond in the possession of the Yardly family.

        "49": "of the present Lord Yardly brought it back with him from China,\nand a romantic story is said to attach to it. According to this,\nthe stone was once the right eye of a temple god. Another diamond,\nexactly similar in form and size, formed the left eye, and the\nstory goes that this jewel, too, would in course of time be stolen.\n",
        "50": "\u2018One eye shall go West, the other East, till they shall meet once\nmore. Then, in triumph shall they return to the god.\u2019 It is a\ncurious coincidence that there is at the present time a stone\ncorresponding closely in description with this one, and known as\n\u2018the Star of the West,\u2019 or \u2018the Western Star.\u2019 It is the property\nof the celebrated film actress, Miss Mary Marvell. A comparison of\n",
        "51": "the two stones would be interesting.\u201d\nShe stopped.\n\u201c_\u00c9patant!_\u201d murmured Poirot. \u201cWithout doubt a romance of the first\n",

        "53": "His tone was mocking, but I fancied that an undercurrent of\nseriousness lay beneath it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that Lady Yardly\u2019s diamond is anything like as\ngood a stone as mine,\u201d said Miss Marvell. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m going to\nsee.\u201d\n",
        "54": "What more Poirot would have said I do not know, for at that moment\nthe door flew open, and a splendid-looking man strode into the\nroom. From his crisply curling black head, to the tips of his\npatent-leather boots, he was a hero fit for romance.\n\u201cI said I\u2019d call round for you, Mary,\u201d said Gregory Rolf, \u201cand here\nI am. Well, what does Monsieur Poirot say to our little problem?\n",
        "55": "Just one big hoax, same as I do?\u201d\nPoirot smiled up at the big actor. They made a ridiculous contrast.\n\u201cHoax or no hoax, Mr. Rolf,\u201d he said dryly, \u201cI have advised Madame\n",

        "57": "\u201cWhat nonsense, Gregory!\u201d said Mary Marvell sharply. But she\nflushed angrily.\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\n",

        "60": "all this. With your permission, _mon ami_, I will take the air.\nAwait my return, I beg of you. I shall not be long.\u201d\nI was half asleep in my chair when the landlady tapped on the door,\nand put her head in.\n",

        "62": "for her.\u201d\nIn another moment the lady had been ushered in. My heart gave a\nleap as I recognized her. Lady Yardly\u2019s portrait had figured too\n",

        "64": "She thanked me and sat down. A very different type, this, from Miss\nMary Marvell. Tall, dark, with flashing eyes, and a pale proud\nface\u2014yet something wistful in the curves of the mouth.\n",
        "65": "I felt a desire to rise to the occasion. Why not? In Poirot\u2019s\npresence I have frequently felt a difficulty\u2014I do not appear at my\nbest. And yet there is no doubt that I, too, possess the deductive\nsense in a marked degree. I leant forward on a sudden impulse.\n",
        "66": "\u201cLady Yardly,\u201d I said, \u201cI know why you have come here. You have\nreceived blackmailing letters about the diamond.\u201d\nThere was no doubt as to my bolt having shot home. She stared at\n",
