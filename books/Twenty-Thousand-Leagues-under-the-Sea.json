        "5": "PART ONE\nCHAPTER I\nA SHIFTING REEF\nThe year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and\npuzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to\nmention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the\npublic mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were\nparticularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels,\nskippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries,\nand the Governments of several states on the two continents, were\ndeeply interested in the matter.\n",
        "6": "For some time past, vessels had been met by \u201can enormous thing,\u201d a long\nobject, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely\nlarger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.\nThe facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books)\nagreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in\nquestion, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power\nof locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If\nit was a cetacean, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified\nin science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at\n",
        "7": "divers times,\u2014rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to\nthis object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated\nopinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length,\u2014we\nmight fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all\ndimensions admitted by the ichthyologists of the day, if it existed at\nall. And that it _did_ exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that\ntendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we\ncan understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this\nsupernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the\nidea was out of the question.\n",
        "8": "On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer _Governor Higginson_, of the\nCalcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass\nfive miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at\nfirst that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even\nprepared to determine its exact position, when two columns of water,\nprojected by the inexplicable object, shot with a hissing noise a\nhundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had\nbeen submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the _Governor\nHigginson_ had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal,\nunknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water\nmixed with air and vapour.\n",
        "9": "Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in\nthe Pacific Ocean, by the _Columbus_, of the West India and Pacific\nSteam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary cetaceous creature\ncould transport itself from one place to another with surprising\nvelocity; as, in an interval of three days, the _Governor Higginson_\nand the _Columbus_ had observed it at two different points of the\nchart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical\nleagues.\nFifteen days later, two thousand miles farther off, the _Helvetia_, of\nthe Compagnie-Nationale, and the _Shannon_, of the Royal Mail Steamship\nCompany, sailing to windward in that portion of the Atlantic lying\nbetween the United States and Europe, respectively signalled the\nmonster to each other in 42\u00b0 15\u2032 N. lat. and 60\u00b0 35\u2032 W. long. In these\n",
        "10": "simultaneous observations they thought themselves justified in\nestimating the minimum length of the mammal at more than three hundred\nand fifty feet, as the _Shannon_ and _Helvetia_ were of smaller\ndimensions than it, though they measured three hundred feet over all.\nNow the largest whales, those which frequent those parts of the sea\nround the Aleutian, Kulammak, and Umgullich islands, have never\nexceeded the length of sixty yards, if they attain that.\nThese reports arriving one after the other, with fresh observations\nmade on board the transatlantic ship _Pereire_, a collision which\noccurred between the _Etna_ of the Inman line and the monster, a\n_proc\u00e8s verbal_ directed by the officers of the French frigate\n_Normandie_, a very accurate survey made by the staff of Commodore\nFitz-James on board the _Lord Clyde_, greatly influenced public\nopinion. Light-thinking people jested upon the phenomenon, but grave\n",
        "11": "practical countries, such as England, America, and Germany, treated the\nmatter more seriously.\nIn every place of great resort the monster was the fashion. They sang\nof it in the caf\u00e9s, ridiculed it in the papers, and represented it on\nthe stage. All kinds of stories were circulated regarding it. There\n",
        "12": "appeared in the papers caricatures of every gigantic and imaginary\ncreature, from the white whale, the terrible \u201cMoby Dick\u201d of hyperborean\nregions, to the immense kraken whose tentacles could entangle a ship of\nfive hundred tons, and hurry it into the abyss of the ocean. The\nlegends of ancient times were even resuscitated, and the opinions of\nAristotle and Pliny revived, who admitted the existence of these\nmonsters, as well as the Norwegian tales of Bishop Pontoppidan, the\naccounts of Paul Heggede, and, last of all, the reports of Mr.\nHarrington (whose good faith no one could suspect), who affirmed that,\nbeing on board the _Castillan_, in 1857, he had seen this enormous\nserpent, which had never until that time frequented any other seas but\nthose of the ancient \u201c_Constitutionnel_.\u201d\n",
        "13": "Then burst forth the interminable controversy between the credulous and\nthe incredulous in the societies of savants and the scientific\njournals. \u201cThe question of the monster\u201d inflamed all minds. Editors of\nscientific journals, quarrelling with believers in the supernatural,\nspilled seas of ink during this memorable campaign, some even drawing\nblood; for, from the sea-serpent they came to direct personalities.\nFor six months war was waged with various fortune in the leading\narticles of the Geographical Institution of Brazil, the Royal Academy\nof Science of Berlin, the British Association, the Smithsonian\nInstitution of Washington, in the discussions of the \u201cIndian\nArchipelago,\u201d of the Cosmos of the Abb\u00e9 Moigno, in the Mittheilungen of\nPetermann, in the scientific chronicles of the great journals of France\nand other countries. The cheaper journals replied keenly and with\n",
        "14": "inexhaustible zest. These satirical writers parodied a remark of\nLinn\u00e6us, quoted by the adversaries of the monster, maintaining \u201cthat\nnature did not make fools,\u201d and adjured their contemporaries not to\ngive the lie to nature, by admitting the existence of krakens,\nsea-serpents, \u201cMoby Dicks,\u201d and other lucubrations of delirious\nsailors. At length an article in a well-known satirical journal by a\nfavourite contributor, the chief of the staff, settled the monster,\nlike Hippolytus, giving it the death-blow amidst an universal burst of\nlaughter. Wit had conquered science.\n",
        "15": "During the first months of the year 1867 the question seemed buried,\nnever to revive, when new facts were brought before the public. It was\nthen no longer a scientific problem to be solved, but a real danger\nseriously to be avoided. The question took quite another shape. The\nmonster became a small island, a rock, a reef, but a reef of indefinite\nand shifting proportions.\n",
        "16": "On the 5th of March, 1867, the _Moravian_, of the Montreal Ocean\nCompany, finding herself during the night in 27\u00b0 30\u2032 lat. and 72\u00b0 15\u2032\nlong., struck on her starboard quarter a rock, marked in no chart for\nthat part of the sea. Under the combined efforts of the wind and its\n",
        "17": "four hundred horse-power, it was going at the rate of thirteen knots.\nHad it not been for the superior strength of the hull of the\n_Moravian_, she would have been broken by the shock and gone down with\nthe 237 passengers she was bringing home from Canada.\nThe accident happened about five o\u2019clock in the morning, as the day was\nbreaking. The officers of the quarter-deck hurried to the after-part of\n",
        "18": "the vessel. They examined the sea with the most scrupulous attention.\nThey saw nothing but a strong eddy about three cables\u2019 length distant,\nas if the surface had been violently agitated. The bearings of the\nplace were taken exactly, and the _Moravian_ continued its route\nwithout apparent damage. Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an\n",
        "19": "enormous wreck? they could not tell; but on examination of the ship\u2019s\nbottom when undergoing repairs, it was found that part of her keel was\nbroken.\nThis fact, so grave in itself, might perhaps have been forgotten like\nmany others if, three weeks after, it had not been re-enacted under\nsimilar circumstances. But, thanks to the nationality of the victim of\n",
        "20": "the shock, thanks to the reputation of the company to which the vessel\nbelonged, the circumstance became extensively circulated.\nThe 13th of April, 1867, the sea being beautiful, the breeze\nfavourable, the _Scotia_, of the Cunard Company\u2019s line, found herself\nin 15\u00b0 12\u2032 long. and 45\u00b0 37\u2032 lat. She was going at the speed of\nthirteen knots and a half.\n",
        "21": "At seventeen minutes past four in the afternoon, whilst the passengers\nwere assembled at lunch in the great saloon, a slight shock was felt on\nthe hull of the _Scotia_, on her quarter, a little aft of the\nport-paddle.\nThe _Scotia_ had not struck, but she had been struck, and seemingly by\nsomething rather sharp and penetrating than blunt. The shock had been\nso slight that no one had been alarmed, had it not been for the shouts\nof the carpenter\u2019s watch, who rushed on to the bridge, exclaiming, \u201cWe\nare sinking! we are sinking!\u201d At first the passengers were much\n",
        "22": "frightened, but Captain Anderson hastened to reassure them. The danger\ncould not be imminent. The _Scotia_, divided into seven compartments by\nstrong partitions, could brave with impunity any leak. Captain Anderson\n",
        "23": "went down immediately into the hold. He found that the sea was pouring\ninto the fifth compartment; and the rapidity of the influx proved that\nthe force of the water was considerable. Fortunately this compartment\ndid not hold the boilers, or the fires would have been immediately\nextinguished. Captain Anderson ordered the engines to be stopped at\n",
        "24": "once, and one of the men went down to ascertain the extent of the\ninjury. Some minutes afterwards they discovered the existence of a\nlarge hole, of two yards in diameter, in the ship\u2019s bottom. Such a leak\ncould not be stopped; and the _Scotia_, her paddles half submerged, was\nobliged to continue her course. She was then three hundred miles from\n",
        "25": "Cape Clear, and after three days\u2019 delay, which caused great uneasiness\nin Liverpool, she entered the basin of the company.\nThe engineers visited the _Scotia_, which was put in dry dock. They\ncould scarcely believe it possible; at two yards and a half below\nwater-mark was a regular rent, in the form of an isosceles triangle.\n",
        "26": "The broken place in the iron plates was so perfectly defined that it\ncould not have been more neatly done by a punch. It was clear, then,\nthat the instrument producing the perforation was not of a common\nstamp; and after having been driven with prodigious strength, and\npiercing an iron plate 1-3/8 inches thick, had withdrawn itself by a\nretrograde motion truly inexplicable.\nSuch was the last fact, which resulted in exciting once more the\ntorrent of public opinion. From this moment all unlucky casualties\n",
        "27": "which could not be otherwise accounted for were put down to the\nmonster. Upon this imaginary creature rested the responsibility of all\nthese shipwrecks, which unfortunately were considerable; for of three\nthousand ships whose loss was annually recorded at Lloyd\u2019s, the number\nof sailing and steam ships supposed to be totally lost, from the\nabsence of all news, amounted to not less than two hundred!\nNow, it was the \u201cmonster\u201d who, justly or unjustly, was accused of their\ndisappearance, and, thanks to it, communication between the different\ncontinents became more and more dangerous. The public demanded\n",
        "28": "peremptorily that the seas should at any price be relieved from this\nformidable cetacean.\nCHAPTER II\nPRO AND CON\nAt the period when these events took place, I had just returned from a\nscientific research in the disagreeable territory of Nebraska, in the\nUnited States. In virtue of my office as Assistant Professor in the\nMuseum of Natural History in Paris, the French Government had attached\nme to that expedition. After six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New\n",
        "29": "York towards the end of March, laden with a precious collection. My\ndeparture for France was fixed for the first days in May. Meanwhile, I\nwas occupying myself in classifying my mineralogical, botanical, and\nzoological riches, when the accident happened to the _Scotia_.\n",
        "30": "I was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day.\nHow could I be otherwise? I had read and re-read all the American and\nEuropean papers without being any nearer a conclusion. This mystery\n",
        "31": "puzzled me. Under the impossibility of forming an opinion, I jumped\nfrom one extreme to the other. That there really was something could\nnot be doubted, and the incredulous were invited to put their finger on\nthe wound of the _Scotia_.\n",
        "32": "On my arrival at New York the question was at its height. The\nhypothesis of the floating island, and the unapproachable sandbank,\nsupported by minds little competent to form a judgment, was abandoned.\nAnd, indeed, unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could\nit change its position with such astonishing rapidity?\n",
        "33": "From the same cause, the idea of a floating hull of an enormous wreck\nwas given up.\nThere remained then only two possible solutions of the question, which\ncreated two distinct parties: on one side, those who were for a monster\nof colossal strength; on the other, those who were for a submarine\nvessel of enormous motive power.\nBut this last hypothesis, plausible as it was, could not stand against\ninquiries made in both worlds. That a private gentleman should have\n",
        "34": "such a machine at his command was not likely. Where, when, and how was\nit built? and how could its construction have been kept secret?\nCertainly a Government might possess such a destructive machine. And in\n",
        "35": "these disastrous times, when the ingenuity of man has multiplied the\npower of weapons of war, it was possible that, without the knowledge of\nothers, a state might try to work such a formidable engine. After the\nchassepots came the torpedoes, after the torpedoes the submarine rams,\nthen\u2014the reaction. At least, I hope so.\nBut the hypothesis of a war machine fell before the declaration of\nGovernments. As public interest was in question, and transatlantic\n",
        "36": "communications suffered, their veracity could not be doubted. But, how\nadmit that the construction of this submarine boat had escaped the\npublic eye? For a private gentleman to keep the secret under such\ncircumstances would be very difficult, and for a state whose every act\nis persistently watched by powerful rivals, certainly impossible.\n",
        "37": "After inquiries made in England, France, Russia, Prussia, Spain, Italy,\nand America, even in Turkey, the hypothesis of a submarine monitor was\ndefinitely rejected.\nUpon my arrival in New York several persons did me the honour of\nconsulting me on the phenomenon in question. I had published in France\na work in quarto, in two volumes, entitled \u201cMysteries of the Great\nSubmarine Grounds.\u201d This book, highly approved of in the learned world,\n",
        "38": "gained for me a special reputation in this rather obscure branch of\nNatural History. My advice was asked. As long as I could deny the\nreality of the fact, I confined myself to a decided negative. But soon,\nfinding myself driven into a corner, I was obliged to explain myself\ncategorically. And even \u201cthe Honourable Pierre Aronnax, Professor in\n",
        "39": "the Museum of Paris,\u201d was called upon by the _New York Herald_ to\nexpress a definite opinion of some sort. I did something. I spoke, for\nwant of power to hold my tongue. I discussed the question in all its\nforms, politically and scientifically; and I give here an extract from\na carefully-studied article which I published in the number of the 30th\nof April. It ran as follows:\u2014\n",
        "40": "\u201cAfter examining one by one the different hypotheses, rejecting all\nother suggestions, it becomes necessary to admit the existence of a\nmarine animal of enormous power.\n\u201cThe great depths of the ocean are entirely unknown to us. Soundings\ncannot reach them. What passes in those remote depths\u2014what beings live,\n",
        "41": "or can live, twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the\nwaters\u2014what is the organisation of these animals, we can scarcely\nconjecture. However, the solution of the problem submitted to me may\nmodify the form of the dilemma. Either we do know all the varieties of\nbeings which people our planet, or we do not. If we do _not_ know them\n",
        "42": "all\u2014if Nature has still secrets in ichthyology for us, nothing is more\nconformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishes, or\ncetaceans of other kinds, or even of new species, of an organisation\nformed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings, and which an\naccident of some sort, either fatastical or capricious, has brought at\nlong intervals to the upper level of the ocean.\n\u201cIf, on the contrary, we _do_ know all living kinds, we must\nnecessarily seek for the animal in question amongst those marine beings\nalready classed; and, in that case, I should be disposed to admit the\nexistence of a gigantic narwhal.\n\u201cThe common narwhal, or unicorn of the sea, often attains a length of\nsixty feet. Increase its size fivefold or tenfold, give it strength\n",
        "43": "proportionate to its size, lengthen its destructive weapons, and you\nobtain the animal required. It will have the proportions determined by\nthe officers of the _Shannon_, the instrument required by the\nperforation of the _Scotia_, and the power necessary to pierce the hull\nof the steamer.\n\u201cIndeed, the narwhal is armed with a sort of ivory sword, a halberd,\naccording to the expression of certain naturalists. The principal tusk\n",
        "44": "has the hardness of steel. Some of these tusks have been found buried\nin the bodies of whales, which the unicorn always attacks with success.\nOthers have been drawn out, not without trouble, from the bottoms of\nships, which they had pierced through and through, as a gimlet pierces\na barrel. The Museum of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris possesses one\n",
        "45": "of these defensive weapons, two yards and a quarter in length, and\nfifteen inches in diameter at the base.\n\u201cVery well! suppose this weapon to be six times stronger and the animal\nten times more powerful; launch it at the rate of twenty miles an hour,\nand you obtain a shock capable of producing the catastrophe required.\n",
        "46": "Until further information, therefore, I shall maintain it to be a\nsea-unicorn of colossal dimensions, armed not with a halberd, but with\na real spur, as the armoured frigates, or the \u2018rams\u2019 of war, whose\nmassiveness and motive power it would possess at the same time. Thus\nmay this puzzling phenomenon be explained, unless there be something\nover and above all that one has ever conjectured, seen, perceived, or\nexperienced; which is just within the bounds of possibility.\u201d\nThese last words were cowardly on my part; but, up to a certain point,\nI wished to shelter my dignity as Professor, and not give too much\ncause for laughter to the Americans, who laugh well when they do laugh.\n",
        "47": "I reserved for myself a way of escape. In effect, however, I admitted\nthe existence of the \u201cmonster.\u201d My article was warmly discussed, which\nprocured it a high reputation. It rallied round it a certain number of\n",

The rapidity of her\nscrew was such that I could neither follow nor count its revolutions.\nWhen I reflected that this marvellous electric agent, after having\nafforded motion, heat, and light to the _Nautilus_, still protected her\nfrom outward attack, and transformed her into an ark of safety which no\nprofane hand might touch without being thunderstricken, my admiration\nwas unbounded, and from the structure it extended to the engineer who\nhad called it into existence.\n",

        "817": "From this point the direction of the _Nautilus_ inclined towards the\nsouth-west. Her head was set for the Indian Ocean. Where would the\nfancy of Captain Nemo carry us next? Would he return to the coast of\nAsia or would he approach again the shores of Europe? Improbable\n",

The speed of the\n_Nautilus_ was considerably abated, and with irregular course she\nsometimes swam in the bosom of the waters, sometimes floated on their\nsurface.\n",
        "820": "During this period of the voyage, Captain Nemo made some interesting\nexperiments on the varied temperature of the sea, in different beds.\nUnder ordinary conditions these observations are made by means of\nrather complicated instruments, and with somewhat doubtful results, by\nmeans of thermometrical sounding-leads, the glasses often breaking\nunder the pressure of the water, or an apparatus grounded on the\nvariations of the resistance of metals to the electric currents.\nResults so obtained could not be correctly calculated. On the contrary,\n",
