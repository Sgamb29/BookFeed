But she was a magnificent monument to\nthe blessing of a want of imagination, and if she could see in our\nlittle charges nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness\nand cleverness, she had no direct communication with the sources of my\ntrouble.

Flights of fancy gave place, in her mind, to a\nsteady fireside glow, and I had already begun to perceive how, with the\ndevelopment of the conviction that\u2014as time went on without a public\naccident\u2014our young things could, after all, look out for themselves,\nshe addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by\ntheir instructress. That, for myself, was a sound simplification: I\ncould engage that, to the world, my face should tell no tales, but it\nwould have been, in the conditions, an immense added strain to find\nmyself anxious about hers.\n",
