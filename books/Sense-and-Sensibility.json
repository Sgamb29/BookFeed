Their estate\nwas large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of\ntheir property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so\nrespectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their\nsurrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single\n",

But her\ndeath, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great\nalteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received\ninto his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal\ninheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to\nbequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their\n",

The son, a steady respectable young man, was\n",

To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not\nso really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent\nof what might arise to them from their father\u2019s inheriting that\nproperty, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their\n",

He was neither so\nunjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;\u2014but\nhe left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the\nbequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife\n",
        "9": "and daughters than for himself or his son;\u2014but to his son, and his\nson\u2019s son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as\nto leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear\nto him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or\nby any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up for the\nbenefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and\nmother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by\nsuch attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three\nyears old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his\nown way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh\nall the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received\nfrom his niece and her daughters. He meant not to be unkind, however,\nand, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a\nthousand pounds a-piece.\n",

Had he married a more amiable woman, he might have\nbeen made still more respectable than he was:\u2014he might even have been\nmade amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and very\nfond of his wife.

        "17": "right to come; the house was her husband\u2019s from the moment of his\nfather\u2019s decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the\ngreater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood\u2019s situation, with only common\nfeelings, must have been highly unpleasing;\u2014but in _her_ mind there was\na sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of\nthe kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of\nimmovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with\nany of her husband\u2019s family; but she had had no opportunity, till the\npresent, of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of\nother people she could act when occasion required it.\n",
        "18": "So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so\nearnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the\narrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had\nnot the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the\npropriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children\ndetermined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach\nwith their brother.\nElinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed\na strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified\nher, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and\nenabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,\nthat eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led\n",
        "19": "to imprudence. She had an excellent heart;\u2014her disposition was\naffectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\nthem: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which\none of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.\nMarianne\u2019s abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor\u2019s.\n",
        "20": "She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her\njoys, could have no moderation. She was generous, amiable, interesting:\nshe was everything but prudent. The resemblance between her and her\nmother was strikingly great.\n",
        "21": "Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister\u2019s sensibility; but\nby Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each\nother now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief which\noverpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought for, was\ncreated again and again.

        "23": "Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but\nas she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne\u2019s romance, without\nhaving much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal\nher sisters at a more advanced period of life.\nCHAPTER II.\nMrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her\n",

But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,\n",

        "30": "hardly suppose I should neglect them. But as he required the promise, I\ncould not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time. The\npromise, therefore, was given, and must be performed. Something must be\n",

I have known a great deal of the trouble\nof annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to\nold superannuated servants by my father\u2019s will, and it is amazing how\ndisagreeable she found it. Twice every year these annuities were to be\n",
        "42": "paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then\none of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be\nno such thing.

Her income was not her\nown, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more\nunkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been\nentirely at my mother\u2019s disposal, without any restriction whatever.

        "46": "\u201cI believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should\nbe no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will\nbe of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they\nwould only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger\nincome, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the\nyear. It will certainly be much the best way. A present of fifty\npounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for\nmoney, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my\nfather.\u201d\n\u201cTo be sure it will. Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within\n",
        "47": "myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at\nall. The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might\nbe reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a\ncomfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,\nand sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they\nare in season. I\u2019ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,\nit would be very strange and unreasonable if he did. Do but consider,\n",

But Marianne abhorred all\nconcealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve; and to aim\nat the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable,\nappeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful\nsubjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.

One moment she feared that no serious design had\never been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunate\nquarrel had taken place between him and her sister;\u2014the distress in\nwhich Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could\nmost reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne\u2019s\nlove for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.\n",

He is, moreover, aware that she _does_\ndisapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at present confess to\nher his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himself obliged, from\nhis dependent situation, to give into her schemes, and absent himself\nfrom Devonshire for a while. You will tell me, I know, that this may or\nmay _not_ have happened; but I will listen to no cavil, unless you can\npoint out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory\nat this.

Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon\nallowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw with what\nconstant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable\nto Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual raptures,\nextolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their\nwhims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate\ndemands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of\nwhatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing,\nor in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her\nappearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.\n",

She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent\nencroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.\nShe saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their\nwork-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt\nno doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment.

Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities\nwhich education might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with\nless tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, of\nrectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, her\nassiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have no\nlasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity\nwith ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in\nconversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward others made\nevery show of attention and deference towards herself perfectly\nvalueless.\n\u201cYou will think my question an odd one, I dare say,\u201d said Lucy to her\none day, as they were walking together from the park to the\ncottage\u2014\u201cbut pray, are you personally acquainted with your\nsister-in-law\u2019s mother, Mrs. Ferrars?\u201d\n",

Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fair\nrivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the\nutmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work. The pianoforte at\nwhich Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, had\nby this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,\nwas luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might\nsafely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting\nsubject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.\n",

        "718": "\u201cI will have you _both_ go,\u201d said Mrs. Dashwood; \u201cthese objections are\nnonsensical. You will have much pleasure in being in London, and\nespecially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to\nanticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety of\nsources; she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her\nacquaintance with her sister-in-law\u2019s family.\u201d\n",
        "719": "Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her\nmother\u2019s dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the\nshock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on this\nattack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to begin\nher design by saying, as calmly as she could, \u201cI like Edward Ferrars\nvery much, and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest of\nthe family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me, whether I am\never known to them or not.\u201d\nMrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing. Marianne lifted up her eyes in\nastonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held\nher tongue.\n",
        "720": "After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the\ninvitation should be fully accepted. Mrs. Jennings received the\ninformation with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness\nand care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her. Sir John was\ndelighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of\nbeing alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in\nLondon, was something. Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being\n",
        "721": "delighted, which was putting herself rather out of her way; and as for\nthe Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy in\ntheir lives as this intelligence made them.\nElinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with\nless reluctance than she had expected to feel. With regard to herself,\nit was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and\nwhen she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her\nsister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all\nher usual animation, and elevated to more than her usual gaiety, she\ncould not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow\nherself to distrust the consequence.\n",
        "722": "Marianne\u2019s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the\nperturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone. Her\nunwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness;\nand at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive. Her\nmother\u2019s affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one of the\nthree, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of\neternal.\n",
        "723": "Their departure took place in the first week in January. The Middletons\nwere to follow in about a week. The Miss Steeles kept their station at\nthe park, and were to quit it only with the rest of the family.\n",

A short, a very\nshort time however must now decide what Willoughby\u2019s intentions were;\nin all probability he was already in town. Marianne\u2019s eagerness to be\ngone declared her dependence on finding him there; and Elinor was\nresolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character\nwhich her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,\nbut likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such\nzealous attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he meant,\nbefore many meetings had taken place.

She sat in\nsilence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely\never voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty\nwithin their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively\naddressed to her sister. To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinor\n",

They reached town by\n",

It\nhad formerly been Charlotte\u2019s, and over the mantelpiece still hung a\nlandscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof of her having\nspent seven years at a great school in town to some effect.\n",
        "729": "As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their\narrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her\nmother, and sat down for that purpose. In a few moments Marianne did\nthe same. \u201c_I_ am writing home, Marianne,\u201d said Elinor; \u201chad not you\nbetter defer your letter for a day or two?\u201d\n",
        "730": "\u201cI am _not_ going to write to my mother,\u201d replied Marianne, hastily,\nand as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry. Elinor said no more; it\nimmediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby; and\nthe conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however\nmysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be\nengaged. This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her\npleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.\n",
        "731": "Marianne\u2019s was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be no\nmore than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with\neager rapidity. Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the\ndirection; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the\nbell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed\nfor her to the two-penny post. This decided the matter at once.\nHer spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them\nwhich prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and this\nagitation increased as the evening drew on. She could scarcely eat any\n",
        "732": "dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed\nanxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.\nIt was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much\nengaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing. The tea\n",
        "733": "things were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed more\nthan once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly\nheard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinor\nfelt secure of its announcing Willoughby\u2019s approach, and Marianne,\nstarting up, moved towards the door. Every thing was silent; this could\nnot be borne many seconds; she opened the door, advanced a few steps\ntowards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returned into\nthe room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him\nwould naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant\nshe could not help exclaiming, \u201cOh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it\nis!\u201d and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when\nColonel Brandon appeared.\n",
        "734": "It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she immediately\nleft the room. Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time her\nregard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her; and she felt\nparticularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive\nthat she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing\nhim. She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he even\nobserved Marianne as she quitted the room, with such astonishment and\nconcern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded\ntowards herself.\n",
        "735": "\u201cIs your sister ill?\u201d said he.\nElinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of\nhead-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to which\nshe could decently attribute her sister\u2019s behaviour.\nHe heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect\nhimself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of\nhis pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries about\ntheir journey, and the friends they had left behind.\n",
        "736": "In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,\nthey continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts\nof both engaged elsewhere. Elinor wished very much to ask whether\nWilloughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by\nany enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying something,\nshe asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, with some embarrassment, \u201calmost ever since; I have\nbeen once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been in\nmy power to return to Barton.\u201d\n",
        "737": "This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to\nher remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, with\nthe uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and she\nwas fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the\nsubject than she had ever felt.\nMrs. Jennings soon came in. \u201cOh!

Pleased to find\nherself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had\nexpected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real\nenjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or\nabroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.\n",

In this situation, Elinor,\nroused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, first perceived her; and\nafter observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety, said, in a\ntone of the most considerate gentleness,\n\u201cMarianne, may I ask\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Elinor,\u201d she replied, \u201cask nothing; you will soon know all.\u201d\n",

That good\nlady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from\nWilloughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which she\ntreated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it to\nher liking.

Mrs. Jennings, knowing\nnothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed; her\nmaid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating herself in\nthe housekeeper\u2019s room, and Elinor remained alone with Marianne.\n",

Edward was allowed to retain the\nprivilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every\nnight to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returned\nin the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers\u2019 first t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate\nbefore breakfast.\n",

Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he\ndid revive.

Mrs. Jennings\u2019s\nprophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; for\nshe was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by\nMichaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her husband, as she really\nbelieved, one of the happiest couples in the world.

But\nperseverance in humility of conduct and messages, in self-condemnation\nfor Robert\u2019s offence, and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated\nwith, procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its\ngraciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest\nstate of affection and influence.

They settled in town, received\nvery liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms\nimaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies and\nill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy, in which their\nhusbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent domestic\ndisagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed\nthe harmony in which they all lived together.\n",
