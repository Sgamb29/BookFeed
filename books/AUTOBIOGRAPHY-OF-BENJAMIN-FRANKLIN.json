        "14": "[Illustration: B. Franklin's signature]\nINTRODUCTION\nWe Americans devour eagerly any piece of writing that purports to tell\nus the secret of success in life; yet how often we are disappointed to\nfind nothing but commonplace statements, or receipts that we know by\nheart but never follow. Most of the life stories of our famous and\nsuccessful men fail to inspire because they lack the human element\nthat makes the record real and brings the story within our grasp.\n",
        "15": "While we are searching far and near for some Aladdin's Lamp to give\ncoveted fortune, there is ready at our hand if we will only reach out\nand take it, like the charm in Milton's _Comus_,\n  \"Unknown, and like esteemed, and the dull swain\n   Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon;\"\nthe interesting, human, and vividly told story of one of the wisest\nand most useful lives in our own history, and perhaps in any history.\nIn Franklin's _Autobiography_ is offered not so much a ready-made\nformula for success, as the companionship of a real flesh and blood\nman of extraordinary mind and quality, whose daily walk and\nconversation will help us to meet our own difficulties, much as does\nthe example of a wise and strong friend. While we are fascinated by\nthe story, we absorb the human experience through which a strong and\nhelpful character is building.\n",
        "16": "The thing that makes Franklin's _Autobiography_ different from every\nother life story of a great and successful man is just this human\naspect of the account. Franklin told the story of his life, as he\nhimself says, for the benefit of his posterity. He wanted to help them\nby the relation of his own rise from obscurity and poverty to eminence\nand wealth. He is not unmindful of the importance of his public\n",
        "17": "services and their recognition, yet his accounts of these achievements\nare given only as a part of the story, and the vanity displayed is\nincidental and in keeping with the honesty of the recital. There is\nnothing of the impossible in the method and practice of Franklin as he\nsets them forth. The youth who reads the fascinating story is\nastonished to find that Franklin in his early years struggled with the\nsame everyday passions and difficulties that he himself experiences,\nand he loses the sense of discouragement that comes from a\nrealization of his own shortcomings and inability to attain.\n",
        "18": "There are other reasons why the _Autobiography_ should be an intimate\nfriend of American young people. Here they may establish a close\nrelationship with one of the foremost Americans as well as one of the\nwisest men of his age.\nThe life of Benjamin Franklin is of importance to every American\nprimarily because of the part he played in securing the independence\nof the United States and in establishing it as a nation. Franklin\n",
        "19": "shares with Washington the honors of the Revolution, and of the events\nleading to the birth of the new nation. While Washington was the\nanimating spirit of the struggle in the colonies, Franklin was its\nablest champion abroad. To Franklin's cogent reasoning and keen\nsatire, we owe the clear and forcible presentation of the American\ncase in England and France; while to his personality and diplomacy as\nwell as to his facile pen, we are indebted for the foreign alliance\nand the funds without which Washington's work must have failed. His\n",
        "20": "patience, fortitude, and practical wisdom, coupled with\nself-sacrificing devotion to the cause of his country, are hardly less\nnoticeable than similar qualities displayed by Washington. In fact,\nFranklin as a public man was much like Washington, especially in the\nentire disinterestedness of his public service.\nFranklin is also interesting to us because by his life and teachings\nhe has done more than any other American to advance the material\nprosperity of his countrymen. It is said that his widely and\n",
        "21": "faithfully read maxims made Philadelphia and Pennsylvania wealthy,\nwhile Poor Richard's pithy sayings, translated into many languages,\nhave had a world-wide influence.\nFranklin is a good type of our American manhood. Although not the\nwealthiest or the most powerful, he is undoubtedly, in the versatility\nof his genius and achievements, the greatest of our self-made men. The\n",
        "22": "simple yet graphic story in the _Autobiography_ of his steady rise\nfrom humble boyhood in a tallow-chandler shop, by industry, economy,\nand perseverance in self-improvement, to eminence, is the most\nremarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men. It is\nin itself a wonderful illustration of the results possible to be\nattained in a land of unequaled opportunity by following Franklin's\nmaxims.\nFranklin's fame, however, was not confined to his own country.\n",
        "23": "Although he lived in a century notable for the rapid evolution of\nscientific and political thought and activity, yet no less a keen\njudge and critic than Lord Jeffrey, the famous editor of the\n_Edinburgh Review_, a century ago said that \"in one point of view\nthe name of Franklin must be considered as standing higher than any of\nthe others which illustrated the eighteenth century. Distinguished as\na statesman, he was equally great as a philosopher, thus uniting in\nhimself a rare degree of excellence in both these pursuits, to excel\nin either of which is deemed the highest praise.\"\nFranklin has indeed been aptly called \"many-sided.\" He was eminent in\n",

He developed journalism, established the American\nPhilosophical Society, the public library in Philadelphia, and the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania.

If Robert Louis Stevenson is right\nin believing that his remarkable style was acquired by imitation then\nthe youth who would gain the power to express his ideas clearly,\nforcibly, and interestingly cannot do better than to study Franklin's\nmethod. Franklin's fame in the scientific world was due almost as much\n",
        "30": "to his modest, simple, and sincere manner of presenting his\ndiscoveries and to the precision and clearness of the style in which\nhe described his experiments, as to the results he was able to\nannounce. Sir Humphry Davy, the celebrated English chemist, himself an\nexcellent literary critic as well as a great scientist, said: \"A\nsingular felicity guided all Franklin's researches, and by very small\nmeans he established very grand truths. The style and manner of his\npublication on electricity are almost as worthy of admiration as the\ndoctrine it contains.\"\n",
        "31": "Franklin's place in literature is hard to determine because he was not\nprimarily a literary man. His aim in his writings as in his life work\nwas to be helpful to his fellow-men. For him writing was never an end\nin itself, but always a means to an end. Yet his success as a\n",
        "32": "scientist, a statesman, and a diplomat, as well as socially, was in no\nlittle part due to his ability as a writer. \"His letters charmed all,\nand made his correspondence eagerly sought. His political arguments\nwere the joy of his party and the dread of his opponents. His\n",

        "34": "importance had been produced in this country--Cotton Mather's\n_Magnalia_, a church history of New England in a ponderous, stiff\nstyle. Franklin was the first American author to gain a wide and\npermanent reputation in Europe. The _Autobiography_, _Poor Richard_,\n_Father Abraham's Speech_ or _The Way to Wealth_, as well as some of\nthe _Bagatelles_, are as widely known abroad as any American writings.\n",
        "35": "Franklin must also be classed as the first American humorist.\nEnglish literature of the eighteenth century was characterized by the\ndevelopment of prose. Periodical literature reached its perfection\nearly in the century in _The Tatler_ and _The Spectator_ of Addison\nand Steele. Pamphleteers flourished throughout the period. The\n",
        "36": "homelier prose of Bunyan and Defoe gradually gave place to the more\nelegant and artificial language of Samuel Johnson, who set the\nstandard for prose writing from 1745 onward. This century saw the\nbeginnings of the modern novel, in Fielding's _Tom Jones_,\nRichardson's _Clarissa Harlowe_, Sterne's _Tristram Shandy_, and\nGoldsmith's _Vicar of Wakefield_. Gibbon wrote _The Decline and Fall\nof the Roman Empire_, Hume his _History of England_, and Adam Smith\nthe _Wealth of Nations_.\n",
        "37": "In the simplicity and vigor of his style Franklin more nearly\nresembles the earlier group of writers. In his first essays he was not\nan inferior imitator of Addison. In his numerous parables, moral\nallegories, and apologues he showed Bunyan's influence. But Franklin\n",
        "38": "was essentially a journalist. In his swift, terse style, he is most\nlike Defoe, who was the first great English journalist and master of\nthe newspaper narrative. The style of both writers is marked by\nhomely, vigorous expression, satire, burlesque, repartee. Here the\n",
        "39": "comparison must end. Defoe and his contemporaries were authors. Their\nvocation was writing and their success rests on the imaginative or\ncreative power they displayed. To authorship Franklin laid no claim.\nHe wrote no work of the imagination. He developed only incidentally a\n",

The _Autobiography_ is Franklin's longest work,\n",
        "41": "and yet it is only a fragment. The first part, written as a letter to\nhis son, William Franklin, was not intended for publication; and the\ncomposition is more informal and the narrative more personal than in\nthe second part, from 1730 on, which was written with a view to\npublication. The entire manuscript shows little evidence of revision.\nIn fact, the expression is so homely and natural that his grandson,\nWilliam Temple Franklin, in editing the work changed some of the\nphrases because he thought them inelegant and vulgar.\n",
        "42": "Franklin began the story of his life while on a visit to his friend,\nBishop Shipley, at Twyford, in Hampshire, southern England, in 1771.\nHe took the manuscript, completed to 1731, with him when he returned\nto Philadelphia in 1775.

        "43": "written manuscript fell into the hands of Abel James, an old friend,\nwho sent a copy to Franklin at Passy, near Paris, urging him to\ncomplete the story. Franklin took up the work at Passy in 1784 and\ncarried the narrative forward a few months. He changed the plan to\nmeet his new purpose of writing to benefit the young reader. His work\n",
        "44": "was soon interrupted and was not resumed until 1788, when he was at\nhome in Philadelphia. He was now old, infirm, and suffering, and was\nstill engaged in public service. Under these discouraging conditions\nthe work progressed slowly. It finally stopped when the narrative\n",
        "45": "reached the year 1757. Copies of the manuscript were sent to friends\nof Franklin in England and France, among others to Monsieur Le\nVeillard at Paris.\nThe first edition of the _Autobiography_ was published in French at\nParis in 1791. It was clumsily and carelessly translated, and was\n",

        "47": "In the meantime the original manuscript of the _Autobiography_ had\nstarted on a varied and adventurous career. It was left by Franklin\nwith his other works to his grandson, William Temple Franklin, whom\nFranklin designated as his literary executor. When Temple Franklin\ncame to publish his grandfather's works in 1817, he sent the original\nmanuscript of the _Autobiography_ to the daughter of Le Veillard in\nexchange for her father's copy, probably thinking the clearer\ntranscript would make better printer's copy. The original manuscript\n",
        "48": "thus found its way to the Le Veillard family and connections, where it\nremained until sold in 1867 to Mr. John Bigelow, United States\nMinister to France. By him it was later sold to Mr. E. Dwight Church\nof New York, and passed with the rest of Mr. Church's library into the\n",

This kite is to be raised when a thunder-gust appears\nto be coming on, and the person who holds the string must stand within\na door or window, or under some cover, so that the silk ribbon may not\nbe wet; and care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame\nof the door or window.

And when the rain has wet the kite and twine, so\nthat it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it stream\nout plentifully from the key on the approach of your knuckle. At this\nkey the phial may be charged; and from electric fire thus obtained,\nspirits may be kindled, and all the electric experiments be performed,\nwhich are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube,\nand thereby the sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning\ncompletely demonstrated.\n",
