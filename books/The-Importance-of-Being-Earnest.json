        "63": "I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say. [Opens case and\nexamines it.] However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the\ninscription inside, I find that the thing isn\u2019t yours after all.\n",
        "64": "JACK.\nOf course it\u2019s mine. [Moving to him.] You have seen me with it a\nhundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written\ninside. It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette\n",
        "65": "case.\nALGERNON.\nOh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should\n",
        "66": "read and what one shouldn\u2019t. More than half of modern culture depends\non what one shouldn\u2019t read.\nJACK.\n",
        "67": "I am quite aware of the fact, and I don\u2019t propose to discuss modern\nculture. It isn\u2019t the sort of thing one should talk of in private. I\nsimply want my cigarette case back.\nALGERNON.\n",
        "68": "Yes; but this isn\u2019t your cigarette case. This cigarette case is a\npresent from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn\u2019t\nknow any one of that name.\nJACK.\n",
        "69": "Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.\nALGERNON.\nYour aunt!\n",
        "70": "JACK.\nYes. Charming old lady she is, too. Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give\nit back to me, Algy.\n",
        "71": "ALGERNON.\n[Retreating to back of sofa.] But why does she call herself little\nCecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells? [Reading.]\n",
        "72": "\u2018From little Cecily with her fondest love.\u2019\nJACK.\n[Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.] My dear fellow, what on earth is\n",
        "73": "there in that? Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a\nmatter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself. You\nseem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is\n",
        "74": "absurd! For Heaven\u2019s sake give me back my cigarette case. [Follows\nAlgernon round the room.]\nALGERNON.\n",
        "75": "Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? \u2018From little Cecily,\nwith her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.\u2019 There is no objection, I\nadmit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what\nher size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can\u2019t quite\nmake out. Besides, your name isn\u2019t Jack at all; it is Ernest.\n",
        "76": "JACK.\nIt isn\u2019t Ernest; it\u2019s Jack.\nALGERNON.\n",
        "77": "You have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to every\none as Ernest. You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your\nname was Ernest. You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in\n",
        "78": "my life. It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn\u2019t\nErnest. It\u2019s on your cards. Here is one of them. [Taking it from case.]\n\u2018Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.\u2019 I\u2019ll keep this as a proof that\n",
        "79": "your name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to\nGwendolen, or to any one else. [Puts the card in his pocket.]\nJACK.\nWell, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the\ncigarette case was given to me in the country.\n",
        "80": "ALGERNON.\nYes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt\nCecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle. Come,\nold boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.\n",
        "81": "JACK.\nMy dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist. It is very\nvulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn\u2019t a dentist. It produces a\n",
        "82": "false impression.\nALGERNON.\nWell, that is exactly what dentists always do. Now, go on! Tell me the\n",
        "83": "whole thing. I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a\nconfirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.\nJACK.\n",
        "84": "Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon\nas you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack\nin the country.\n",
        "85": "JACK.\nWell, produce my cigarette case first.\nALGERNON.\n",
        "86": "Here it is. [Hands cigarette case.] Now produce your explanation, and\npray make it improbable. [Sits on sofa.]\nJACK.\n",
        "87": "My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at\nall. In fact it\u2019s perfectly ordinary. Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who\nadopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his\ngrand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew. Cecily, who addresses me as her\nuncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate,\nlives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable\ngoverness, Miss Prism.\n",
        "88": "ALGERNON.\nWhere is that place in the country, by the way?\nJACK.\n",
        "89": "That is nothing to you, dear boy. You are not going to be invited . . .\nI may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.\nALGERNON.\n",
        "90": "I suspected that, my dear fellow! I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire\non two separate occasions. Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town and\nJack in the country?\n",
        "91": "JACK.\nMy dear Algy, I don\u2019t know whether you will be able to understand my\nreal motives. You are hardly serious enough. When one is placed in the\nposition of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all\nsubjects. It\u2019s one\u2019s duty to do so. And as a high moral tone can hardly\n",
        "92": "be said to conduce very much to either one\u2019s health or one\u2019s happiness,\nin order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger\nbrother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into\nthe most dreadful scrapes. That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure\nand simple.\nALGERNON.\n",
        "93": "The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very\ntedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete\nimpossibility!\nJACK.\n",
        "94": "That wouldn\u2019t be at all a bad thing.\nALGERNON.\nLiterary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow. Don\u2019t try it. You\n",
        "95": "should leave that to people who haven\u2019t been at a University. They do\nit so well in the daily papers. What you really are is a Bunburyist. I\nwas quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist. You are one of the\n",
        "96": "most advanced Bunburyists I know.\nJACK.\nWhat on earth do you mean?\n",
        "97": "ALGERNON.\nYou have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order\nthat you may be able to come up to town as often as you like. I have\ninvented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that\nI may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose. Bunbury is\n",
        "98": "perfectly invaluable. If it wasn\u2019t for Bunbury\u2019s extraordinary bad\nhealth, for instance, I wouldn\u2019t be able to dine with you at Willis\u2019s\nto-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than\na week.\nJACK.\n",
        "99": "I haven\u2019t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.\nALGERNON.\nI know. You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations. It is\n",
        "100": "very foolish of you. Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving\ninvitations.\nJACK.\n",
        "101": "You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.\nALGERNON.\nI haven\u2019t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind. To\n",

In the second place, whenever I do dine\nthere I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with\neither no woman at all, or two. In the third place, I know perfectly\nwell whom she will place me next to, to-night. She will place me next\n",
        "103": "Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the\ndinner-table. That is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is not even decent\n. . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase. The amount\nof women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly\nscandalous. It looks so bad. It is simply washing one\u2019s clean linen in\n",
        "104": "public. Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I\nnaturally want to talk to you about Bunburying. I want to tell you the\nrules.\n",
        "105": "JACK.\nI\u2019m not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to\nkill my brother, indeed I think I\u2019ll kill him in any case. Cecily is a\n",
        "106": "little too much interested in him. It is rather a bore. So I am going\nto get rid of Ernest. And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr.\n. . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.\n",
        "107": "ALGERNON.\nNothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get\nmarried, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad\nto know Bunbury. A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very\ntedious time of it.\n",
        "108": "JACK.\nThat is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is\nthe only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly\nwon\u2019t want to know Bunbury.\n",
        "109": "ALGERNON.\nThen your wife will. You don\u2019t seem to realise, that in married life\nthree is company and two is none.\n",
        "110": "JACK.\n[Sententiously.] That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the\ncorrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.\n",
        "111": "ALGERNON.\nYes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.\nJACK.\n",
        "112": "For heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t try to be cynical. It\u2019s perfectly easy to be\ncynical.\nALGERNON.\n",
        "113": "My dear fellow, it isn\u2019t easy to be anything nowadays. There\u2019s such a\nlot of beastly competition about. [The sound of an electric bell is\nheard.] Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta. Only relatives, or creditors,\n",

        "115": "I suppose so, if you want to.\nALGERNON.\nYes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not\n",
