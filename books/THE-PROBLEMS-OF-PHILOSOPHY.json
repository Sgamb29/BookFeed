    "THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY": {
        "1": "THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY\nBy Bertrand Russell\nPREFACE\nIn the following pages I have confined myself in the main to those\nproblems of philosophy in regard to which I thought it possible to say\nsomething positive and constructive, since merely negative criticism\nseemed out of place. For this reason, theory of knowledge occupies a\nlarger space than metaphysics in the present volume, and some topics\nmuch discussed by philosophers are treated very briefly, if at all.\nI have derived valuable assistance from unpublished writings of G. E.\n",
        "2": "Moore and J. M. Keynes: from the former, as regards the relations\nof sense-data to physical objects, and from the latter as regards\nprobability and induction. I have also profited greatly by the\ncriticisms and suggestions of Professor Gilbert Murray.\n",
        "3": "1912\nCHAPTER I. APPEARANCE AND REALITY\nIs there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no\nreasonable man could doubt it? This question, which at first sight might\nnot seem difficult, is really one of the most difficult that can\nbe asked. When we have realized the obstacles in the way of a\n",
        "4": "straightforward and confident answer, we shall be well launched on the\nstudy of philosophy--for philosophy is merely the attempt to answer\nsuch ultimate questions, not carelessly and dogmatically, as we do in\nordinary life and even in the sciences, but critically, after exploring\nall that makes such questions puzzling, and after realizing all the\nvagueness and confusion that underlie our ordinary ideas.\nIn daily life, we assume as certain many things which, on a closer\nscrutiny, are found to be so full of apparent contradictions that only a\ngreat amount of thought enables us to know what it is that we really may\nbelieve. In the search for certainty, it is natural to begin with our\npresent experiences, and in some sense, no doubt, knowledge is to be\nderived from them. But any statement as to what it is that our immediate\n",
        "5": "experiences make us know is very likely to be wrong. It seems to me that\nI am now sitting in a chair, at a table of a certain shape, on which I\nsee sheets of paper with writing or print. By turning my head I see out\nof the window buildings and clouds and the sun. I believe that the sun\n",
        "6": "is about ninety-three million miles from the earth; that it is a hot\nglobe many times bigger than the earth; that, owing to the earth's\nrotation, it rises every morning, and will continue to do so for an\nindefinite time in the future. I believe that, if any other normal\nperson comes into my room, he will see the same chairs and tables and\nbooks and papers as I see, and that the table which I see is the same as\nthe table which I feel pressing against my arm. All this seems to be\nso evident as to be hardly worth stating, except in answer to a man who\ndoubts whether I know anything. Yet all this may be reasonably doubted,\n",
        "7": "and all of it requires much careful discussion before we can be sure\nthat we have stated it in a form that is wholly true.\nTo make our difficulties plain, let us concentrate attention on the\ntable. To the eye it is oblong, brown and shiny, to the touch it is\nsmooth and cool and hard; when I tap it, it gives out a wooden sound.\n",
        "8": "Any one else who sees and feels and hears the table will agree with this\ndescription, so that it might seem as if no difficulty would arise;\nbut as soon as we try to be more precise our troubles begin. Although\nI believe that the table is 'really' of the same colour all over, the\nparts that reflect the light look much brighter than the other parts,\nand some parts look white because of reflected light. I know that, if\nI move, the parts that reflect the light will be different, so that the\napparent distribution of colours on the table will change. It follows\n",
        "9": "that if several people are looking at the table at the same moment, no\ntwo of them will see exactly the same distribution of colours, because\nno two can see it from exactly the same point of view, and any change in\nthe point of view makes some change in the way the light is reflected.\nFor most practical purposes these differences are unimportant, but to\nthe painter they are all-important: the painter has to unlearn the habit\nof thinking that things seem to have the colour which common sense says\nthey 'really' have, and to learn the habit of seeing things as they\nappear. Here we have already the beginning of one of the distinctions\nthat cause most trouble in philosophy--the distinction between\n'appearance' and 'reality', between what things seem to be and what they\nare. The painter wants to know what things seem to be, the practical man\n",
        "10": "and the philosopher want to know what they are; but the philosopher's\nwish to know this is stronger than the practical man's, and is more\ntroubled by knowledge as to the difficulties of answering the question.\nTo return to the table. It is evident from what we have found, that\nthere is no colour which pre-eminently appears to be _the_ colour of the\ntable, or even of any one particular part of the table--it appears to\nbe of different colours from different points of view, and there is\nno reason for regarding some of these as more really its colour than\nothers. And we know that even from a given point of view the colour will\n",
        "11": "seem different by artificial light, or to a colour-blind man, or to a\nman wearing blue spectacles, while in the dark there will be no colour\nat all, though to touch and hearing the table will be unchanged. This\ncolour is not something which is inherent in the table, but something\ndepending upon the table and the spectator and the way the light falls\non the table. When, in ordinary life, we speak of _the_ colour of the\ntable, we only mean the sort of colour which it will seem to have to a\nnormal spectator from an ordinary point of view under usual conditions\nof light. But the other colours which appear under other conditions\n",
        "12": "have just as good a right to be considered real; and therefore, to avoid\nfavouritism, we are compelled to deny that, in itself, the table has any\none particular colour.\nThe same thing applies to the texture. With the naked eye one can see\nthe grain, but otherwise the table looks smooth and even. If we looked\n",
        "13": "at it through a microscope, we should see roughnesses and hills and\nvalleys, and all sorts of differences that are imperceptible to the\nnaked eye. Which of these is the 'real' table? We are naturally tempted\nto say that what we see through the microscope is more real, but that in\nturn would be changed by a still more powerful microscope. If, then, we\ncannot trust what we see with the naked eye, why should we trust what we\nsee through a microscope? Thus, again, the confidence in our senses with\n",
        "14": "which we began deserts us.\nThe shape of the table is no better. We are all in the habit of judging\nas to the 'real' shapes of things, and we do this so unreflectingly that\nwe come to think we actually see the real shapes. But, in fact, as we\n",
        "15": "all have to learn if we try to draw, a given thing looks different\nin shape from every different point of view. If our table is 'really'\nrectangular, it will look, from almost all points of view, as if it had\ntwo acute angles and two obtuse angles. If opposite sides are parallel,\nthey will look as if they converged to a point away from the spectator;\nif they are of equal length, they will look as if the nearer side were\nlonger. All these things are not commonly noticed in looking at a table,\n",
        "16": "because experience has taught us to construct the 'real' shape from the\napparent shape, and the 'real' shape is what interests us as practical\nmen. But the 'real' shape is not what we see; it is something inferred\nfrom what we see. And what we see is constantly changing in shape as we\nmove about the room; so that here again the senses seem not to give us\nthe truth about the table itself, but only about the appearance of the\ntable.\n",
        "17": "Similar difficulties arise when we consider the sense of touch. It is\ntrue that the table always gives us a sensation of hardness, and we feel\nthat it resists pressure. But the sensation we obtain depends upon how\nhard we press the table and also upon what part of the body we press\nwith; thus the various sensations due to various pressures or various\nparts of the body cannot be supposed to reveal _directly_ any definite\nproperty of the table, but at most to be _signs_ of some property which\nperhaps _causes_ all the sensations, but is not actually apparent in any\nof them. And the same applies still more obviously to the sounds which\n",
        "18": "can be elicited by rapping the table.\nThus it becomes evident that the real table, if there is one, is not the\nsame as what we immediately experience by sight or touch or hearing. The\nreal table, if there is one, is not _immediately_ known to us at all,\nbut must be an inference from what is immediately known. Hence, two very\n",
        "19": "difficult questions at once arise; namely, (1) Is there a real table at\nall? (2) If so, what sort of object can it be?\nIt will help us in considering these questions to have a few simple\nterms of which the meaning is definite and clear. Let us give the name\nof 'sense-data' to the things that are immediately known in sensation:\nsuch things as colours, sounds, smells, hardnesses, roughnesses, and\nso on. We shall give the name 'sensation' to the experience of being\n",
        "20": "immediately aware of these things. Thus, whenever we see a colour,\nwe have a sensation _of_ the colour, but the colour itself is a\nsense-datum, not a sensation. The colour is that _of_ which we are\nimmediately aware, and the awareness itself is the sensation. It is\n",
        "21": "plain that if we are to know anything about the table, it must be\nby means of the sense-data--brown colour, oblong shape, smoothness,\netc.--which we associate with the table; but, for the reasons which have\nbeen given, we cannot say that the table is the sense-data, or even\nthat the sense-data are directly properties of the table. Thus a problem\narises as to the relation of the sense-data to the real table, supposing\nthere is such a thing.\n",
        "22": "The real table, if it exists, we will call a 'physical object'. Thus\nwe have to consider the relation of sense-data to physical objects.\nThe collection of all physical objects is called 'matter'. Thus our two\n",
        "23": "questions may be re-stated as follows: (1) Is there any such thing as\nmatter? (2) If so, what is its nature?\nThe philosopher who first brought prominently forward the reasons\nfor regarding the immediate objects of our senses as not existing\nindependently of us was Bishop Berkeley (1685-1753). His _Three\nDialogues between Hylas and Philonous, in Opposition to Sceptics and\nAtheists_, undertake to prove that there is no such thing as matter at\nall, and that the world consists of nothing but minds and their ideas.\n",
        "24": "Hylas has hitherto believed in matter, but he is no match for Philonous,\nwho mercilessly drives him into contradictions and paradoxes, and makes\nhis own denial of matter seem, in the end, as if it were almost common\nsense. The arguments employed are of very different value: some are\nimportant and sound, others are confused or quibbling. But Berkeley\nretains the merit of having shown that the existence of matter is\ncapable of being denied without absurdity, and that if there are any\nthings that exist independently of us they cannot be the immediate\nobjects of our sensations.\n",
        "25": "There are two different questions involved when we ask whether matter\nexists, and it is important to keep them clear. We commonly mean by\n'matter' something which is opposed to 'mind', something which we think\nof as occupying space and as radically incapable of any sort of thought\nor consciousness. It is chiefly in this sense that Berkeley denies\nmatter; that is to say, he does not deny that the sense-data which we\ncommonly take as signs of the existence of the table are really signs\nof the existence of _something_ independent of us, but he does deny\nthat this something is non-mental, that it is neither mind nor ideas\nentertained by some mind. He admits that there must be something which\n",
        "26": "continues to exist when we go out of the room or shut our eyes, and that\nwhat we call seeing the table does really give us reason for believing\nin something which persists even when we are not seeing it. But he\nthinks that this something cannot be radically different in nature from\nwhat we see, and cannot be independent of seeing altogether, though it\nmust be independent of _our_ seeing. He is thus led to regard the 'real'\ntable as an idea in the mind of God. Such an idea has the required\n",
        "27": "permanence and independence of ourselves, without being--as matter would\notherwise be--something quite unknowable, in the sense that we can only\ninfer it, and can never be directly and immediately aware of it.\nOther philosophers since Berkeley have also held that, although the\ntable does not depend for its existence upon being seen by me, it does\ndepend upon being seen (or otherwise apprehended in sensation) by\n_some_ mind--not necessarily the mind of God, but more often the whole\ncollective mind of the universe. This they hold, as Berkeley does,\nchiefly because they think there can be nothing real--or at any rate\nnothing known to be real except minds and their thoughts and feelings.\n",
        "28": "We might state the argument by which they support their view in some\nsuch way as this: 'Whatever can be thought of is an idea in the mind of\nthe person thinking of it; therefore nothing can be thought of except\nideas in minds; therefore anything else is inconceivable, and what is\ninconceivable cannot exist.'\nSuch an argument, in my opinion, is fallacious; and of course those who\nadvance it do not put it so shortly or so crudely. But whether valid or\nnot, the argument has been very widely advanced in one form or another;\nand very many philosophers, perhaps a majority, have held that there is\nnothing real except minds and their ideas. Such philosophers are called\n",
        "29": "'idealists'. When they come to explaining matter, they either say, like\nBerkeley, that matter is really nothing but a collection of ideas,\nor they say, like Leibniz (1646-1716), that what appears as matter is\nreally a collection of more or less rudimentary minds.\nBut these philosophers, though they deny matter as opposed to mind,\nnevertheless, in another sense, admit matter. It will be remembered that\n",
        "30": "we asked two questions; namely, (1) Is there a real table at all? (2) If\nso, what sort of object can it be? Now both Berkeley and Leibniz admit\nthat there is a real table, but Berkeley says it is certain ideas in the\nmind of God, and Leibniz says it is a colony of souls. Thus both of them\n",
        "31": "answer our first question in the affirmative, and only diverge from the\nviews of ordinary mortals in their answer to our second question. In\nfact, almost all philosophers seem to be agreed that there is a real\ntable: they almost all agree that, however much our sense-data--colour,\nshape, smoothness, etc.--may depend upon us, yet their occurrence is\na sign of something existing independently of us, something differing,\nperhaps, completely from our sense-data, and yet to be regarded as\ncausing those sense-data whenever we are in a suitable relation to the\nreal table.\n",
        "32": "Now obviously this point in which the philosophers are agreed--the view\nthat there _is_ a real table, whatever its nature may be--is vitally\nimportant, and it will be worth while to consider what reasons there are\nfor accepting this view before we go on to the further question as\nto the nature of the real table. Our next chapter, therefore, will be\nconcerned with the reasons for supposing that there is a real table at\nall.\nBefore we go farther it will be well to consider for a moment what it\nis that we have discovered so far. It has appeared that, if we take any\n",
        "33": "common object of the sort that is supposed to be known by the senses,\nwhat the senses _immediately_ tell us is not the truth about the object\nas it is apart from us, but only the truth about certain sense-data\nwhich, so far as we can see, depend upon the relations between us and\nthe object. Thus what we directly see and feel is merely 'appearance',\nwhich we believe to be a sign of some 'reality' behind. But if the\nreality is not what appears, have we any means of knowing whether there\nis any reality at all? And if so, have we any means of finding out what\n",
        "34": "it is like?\nSuch questions are bewildering, and it is difficult to know that even\nthe strangest hypotheses may not be true. Thus our familiar table,\nwhich has roused but the slightest thoughts in us hitherto, has become a\nproblem full of surprising possibilities. The one thing we know about it\n",
        "35": "is that it is not what it seems. Beyond this modest result, so far, we\nhave the most complete liberty of conjecture. Leibniz tells us it is a\ncommunity of souls: Berkeley tells us it is an idea in the mind of God;\nsober science, scarcely less wonderful, tells us it is a vast collection\nof electric charges in violent motion.\n",
        "36": "Among these surprising possibilities, doubt suggests that perhaps there\nis no table at all. Philosophy, if it cannot _answer_ so many questions\nas we could wish, has at least the power of _asking_ questions which\nincrease the interest of the world, and show the strangeness and wonder\nlying just below the surface even in the commonest things of daily life.\nCHAPTER II. THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER\n",
        "37": "In this chapter we have to ask ourselves whether, in any sense at all,\nthere is such a thing as matter. Is there a table which has a certain\nintrinsic nature, and continues to exist when I am not looking, or is\nthe table merely a product of my imagination, a dream-table in a very\nprolonged dream? This question is of the greatest importance. For if\nwe cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, we cannot\nbe sure of the independent existence of other people's bodies, and\ntherefore still less of other people's minds, since we have no grounds\nfor believing in their minds except such as are derived from observing\ntheir bodies. Thus if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of\n",
        "38": "objects, we shall be left alone in a desert--it may be that the whole\nouter world is nothing but a dream, and that we alone exist. This is an\nuncomfortable possibility; but although it cannot be strictly proved to\nbe false, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that it is true.\nIn this chapter we have to see why this is the case.\n",
        "39": "Before we embark upon doubtful matters, let us try to find some more\nor less fixed point from which to start. Although we are doubting the\nphysical existence of the table, we are not doubting the existence\nof the sense-data which made us think there was a table; we are not\ndoubting that, while we look, a certain colour and shape appear to us,\nand while we press, a certain sensation of hardness is experienced by\nus. All this, which is psychological, we are not calling in question.\nIn fact, whatever else may be doubtful, some at least of our immediate\nexperiences seem absolutely certain.\n",
        "40": "Descartes (1596-1650), the founder of modern philosophy, invented a\nmethod which may still be used with profit--the method of systematic\ndoubt. He determined that he would believe nothing which he did not see\nquite clearly and distinctly to be true. Whatever he could bring himself\nto doubt, he would doubt, until he saw reason for not doubting it.\n",
        "41": "By applying this method he gradually became convinced that the only\nexistence of which he could be _quite_ certain was his own. He imagined\na deceitful demon, who presented unreal things to his senses in a\nperpetual phantasmagoria; it might be very improbable that such a demon\nexisted, but still it was possible, and therefore doubt concerning\nthings perceived by the senses was possible.\nBut doubt concerning his own existence was not possible, for if he did\nnot exist, no demon could deceive him. If he doubted, he must exist; if\n",
        "42": "he had any experiences whatever, he must exist. Thus his own existence\nwas an absolute certainty to him. 'I think, therefore I am,' he said\n(_Cogito, ergo sum_); and on the basis of this certainty he set to work\nto build up again the world of knowledge which his doubt had laid in\nruins. By inventing the method of doubt, and by showing that subjective\n",
        "43": "things are the most certain, Descartes performed a great service to\nphilosophy, and one which makes him still useful to all students of the\nsubject.\nBut some care is needed in using Descartes' argument. 'I think,\ntherefore I am' says rather more than is strictly certain. It might seem\n",
        "44": "as though we were quite sure of being the same person to-day as we were\nyesterday, and this is no doubt true in some sense. But the real Self is\nas hard to arrive at as the real table, and does not seem to have that\nabsolute, convincing certainty that belongs to particular experiences.\nWhen I look at my table and see a certain brown colour, what is quite\ncertain at once is not '_I_ am seeing a brown colour', but rather,\n'a brown colour is being seen'. This of course involves something (or\n",
        "45": "somebody) which (or who) sees the brown colour; but it does not of\nitself involve that more or less permanent person whom we call 'I'. So\nfar as immediate certainty goes, it might be that the something which\nsees the brown colour is quite momentary, and not the same as the\nsomething which has some different experience the next moment.\nThus it is our particular thoughts and feelings that have primitive\ncertainty. And this applies to dreams and hallucinations as well as to\n",
        "46": "normal perceptions: when we dream or see a ghost, we certainly do have\nthe sensations we think we have, but for various reasons it is held that\nno physical object corresponds to these sensations. Thus the certainty\nof our knowledge of our own experiences does not have to be limited in\nany way to allow for exceptional cases. Here, therefore, we have, for\nwhat it is worth, a solid basis from which to begin our pursuit of\nknowledge.\n",
        "47": "The problem we have to consider is this: Granted that we are certain of\nour own sense-data, have we any reason for regarding them as signs of\nthe existence of something else, which we can call the physical object?\nWhen we have enumerated all the sense-data which we should naturally\nregard as connected with the table, have we said all there is to say\nabout the table, or is there still something else--something not a\nsense-datum, something which persists when we go out of the room? Common\nsense unhesitatingly answers that there is. What can be bought and sold\n",
        "48": "and pushed about and have a cloth laid on it, and so on, cannot be\na _mere_ collection of sense-data. If the cloth completely hides the\ntable, we shall derive no sense-data from the table, and therefore, if\nthe table were merely sense-data, it would have ceased to exist, and\nthe cloth would be suspended in empty air, resting, by a miracle, in\nthe place where the table formerly was. This seems plainly absurd; but\nwhoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened\nby absurdities.\n",
        "49": "One great reason why it is felt that we must secure a physical object\nin addition to the sense-data, is that we want the same object for\ndifferent people. When ten people are sitting round a dinner-table,\nit seems preposterous to maintain that they are not seeing the same\ntablecloth, the same knives and forks and spoons and glasses. But the\nsense-data are private to each separate person; what is immediately\npresent to the sight of one is not immediately present to the sight of\nanother: they all see things from slightly different points of view, and\ntherefore see them slightly differently. Thus, if there are to be public\n",
        "50": "neutral objects, which can be in some sense known to many different\npeople, there must be something over and above the private and\nparticular sense-data which appear to various people. What reason, then,\nhave we for believing that there are such public neutral objects?\nThe first answer that naturally occurs to one is that, although\ndifferent people may see the table slightly differently, still they all\nsee more or less similar things when they look at the table, and\nthe variations in what they see follow the laws of perspective and\nreflection of light, so that it is easy to arrive at a permanent object\nunderlying all the different people's sense-data. I bought my table from\n",
        "51": "the former occupant of my room; I could not buy _his_ sense-data,\nwhich died when he went away, but I could and did buy the confident\nexpectation of more or less similar sense-data. Thus it is the fact that\ndifferent people have similar sense-data, and that one person in a given\nplace at different times has similar sense-data, which makes us suppose\nthat over and above the sense-data there is a permanent public object\nwhich underlies or causes the sense-data of various people at various\ntimes.\nNow in so far as the above considerations depend upon supposing that\nthere are other people besides ourselves, they beg the very question at\nissue. Other people are represented to me by certain sense-data, such as\n",
        "52": "the sight of them or the sound of their voices, and if I had no\nreason to believe that there were physical objects independent of my\nsense-data, I should have no reason to believe that other people exist\nexcept as part of my dream. Thus, when we are trying to show that there\nmust be objects independent of our own sense-data, we cannot appeal to\nthe testimony of other people, since this testimony itself consists of\nsense-data, and does not reveal other people's experiences unless our\nown sense-data are signs of things existing independently of us. We must\ntherefore, if possible, find, in our own purely private experiences,\ncharacteristics which show, or tend to show, that there are in the world\nthings other than ourselves and our private experiences.\n",
        "53": "In one sense it must be admitted that we can never prove the existence\nof things other than ourselves and our experiences. No logical absurdity\nresults from the hypothesis that the world consists of myself and my\nthoughts and feelings and sensations, and that everything else is mere\nfancy. In dreams a very complicated world may seem to be present, and\nyet on waking we find it was a delusion; that is to say, we find that\nthe sense-data in the dream do not appear to have corresponded with such\nphysical objects as we should naturally infer from our sense-data. (It\n",
        "54": "is true that, when the physical world is assumed, it is possible to\nfind physical causes for the sense-data in dreams: a door banging, for\ninstance, may cause us to dream of a naval engagement. But although, in\nthis case, there is a physical cause for the sense-data, there is not a\nphysical object corresponding to the sense-data in the way in which an\nactual naval battle would correspond.) There is no logical impossibility\nin the supposition that the whole of life is a dream, in which we\nourselves create all the objects that come before us. But although this\n",
        "55": "is not logically impossible, there is no reason whatever to suppose that\nit is true; and it is, in fact, a less simple hypothesis, viewed as a\nmeans of accounting for the facts of our own life, than the common-sense\nhypothesis that there really are objects independent of us, whose action\non us causes our sensations.\nThe way in which simplicity comes in from supposing that there really\nare physical objects is easily seen. If the cat appears at one moment in\none part of the room, and at another in another part, it is natural\nto suppose that it has moved from the one to the other, passing over\na series of intermediate positions. But if it is merely a set of\n",
        "56": "sense-data, it cannot have ever been in any place where I did not see\nit; thus we shall have to suppose that it did not exist at all while I\nwas not looking, but suddenly sprang into being in a new place. If\nthe cat exists whether I see it or not, we can understand from our own\nexperience how it gets hungry between one meal and the next; but if\nit does not exist when I am not seeing it, it seems odd that appetite\nshould grow during non-existence as fast as during existence. And if the\ncat consists only of sense-data, it cannot be hungry, since no hunger\nbut my own can be a sense-datum to me. Thus the behaviour of the\n",
        "57": "sense-data which represent the cat to me, though it seems quite natural\nwhen regarded as an expression of hunger, becomes utterly inexplicable\nwhen regarded as mere movements and changes of patches of colour, which\nare as incapable of hunger as a triangle is of playing football.\nBut the difficulty in the case of the cat is nothing compared to the\ndifficulty in the case of human beings. When human beings speak--that\nis, when we hear certain noises which we associate with ideas, and\nsimultaneously see certain motions of lips and expressions of face--it\nis very difficult to suppose that what we hear is not the expression\nof a thought, as we know it would be if we emitted the same sounds. Of\n",
        "58": "course similar things happen in dreams, where we are mistaken as to the\nexistence of other people. But dreams are more or less suggested by what\nwe call waking life, and are capable of being more or less accounted for\non scientific principles if we assume that there really is a physical\nworld. Thus every principle of simplicity urges us to adopt the natural\nview, that there really are objects other than ourselves and our\nsense-data which have an existence not dependent upon our perceiving\nthem.\n",
        "59": "Of course it is not by argument that we originally come by our belief in\nan independent external world. We find this belief ready in ourselves as\nsoon as we begin to reflect: it is what may be called an _instinctive_\nbelief. We should never have been led to question this belief but for\nthe fact that, at any rate in the case of sight, it seems as if the\nsense-datum itself were instinctively believed to be the independent\nobject, whereas argument shows that the object cannot be identical\nwith the sense-datum.

Since this belief\ndoes not lead to any difficulties, but on the contrary tends to simplify\nand systematize our account of our experiences, there seems no good\nreason for rejecting it. We may therefore admit--though with a slight\ndoubt derived from dreams--that the external world does really exist,\nand is not wholly dependent for its existence upon our continuing to\nperceive it.\n",
        "61": "The argument which has led us to this conclusion is doubtless less\nstrong than we could wish, but it is typical of many philosophical\narguments, and it is therefore worth while to consider briefly its\ngeneral character and validity. All knowledge, we find, must be built\nup upon our instinctive beliefs, and if these are rejected, nothing\nis left. But among our instinctive beliefs some are much stronger than\nothers, while many have, by habit and association, become entangled with\nother beliefs, not really instinctive, but falsely supposed to be part\nof what is believed instinctively.\n",
        "62": "Philosophy should show us the hierarchy of our instinctive beliefs,\nbeginning with those we hold most strongly, and presenting each as much\nisolated and as free from irrelevant additions as possible. It should\ntake care to show that, in the form in which they are finally set forth,\nour instinctive beliefs do not clash, but form a harmonious system.\nThere can never be any reason for rejecting one instinctive belief\nexcept that it clashes with others; thus, if they are found to\nharmonize, the whole system becomes worthy of acceptance.\n",
        "63": "It is of course _possible_ that all or any of our beliefs may be\nmistaken, and therefore all ought to be held with at least some slight\nelement of doubt. But we cannot have _reason_ to reject a belief except\non the ground of some other belief. Hence, by organizing our instinctive\nbeliefs and their consequences, by considering which among them is most\npossible, if necessary, to modify or abandon, we can arrive, on the\nbasis of accepting as our sole data what we instinctively believe, at an\norderly systematic organization of our knowledge, in which, though the\n_possibility_ of error remains, its likelihood is diminished by the\ninterrelation of the parts and by the critical scrutiny which has\npreceded acquiescence.\n",
        "64": "This function, at least, philosophy can perform. Most philosophers,\nrightly or wrongly, believe that philosophy can do much more than\nthis--that it can give us knowledge, not otherwise attainable,\nconcerning the universe as a whole, and concerning the nature of\nultimate reality. Whether this be the case or not, the more modest\nfunction we have spoken of can certainly be performed by philosophy, and\ncertainly suffices, for those who have once begun to doubt the adequacy\nof common sense, to justify the arduous and difficult labours that\nphilosophical problems involve.\n",
        "65": "CHAPTER III. THE NATURE OF MATTER\nIn the preceding chapter we agreed, though without being able to\nfind demonstrative reasons, that it is rational to believe that our\nsense-data--for example, those which we regard as associated with my\ntable--are really signs of the existence of something independent of us\nand our perceptions. That is to say, over and above the sensations of\ncolour, hardness, noise, and so on, which make up the appearance of\nthe table to me, I assume that there is something else, of which these\nthings are appearances. The colour ceases to exist if I shut my eyes,\n",

The question we have to consider in this chapter is: What\n",

A wave-motion, on the contrary, could quite well be\ndescribed to a blind man, since he can acquire a knowledge of space by\nthe sense of touch; and he can experience a wave-motion by a sea voyage\nalmost as well as we can.

To begin with, it is plain that the\ncolour we see depends only upon the nature of the light-waves that\nstrike the eye, and is therefore modified by the medium intervening\nbetween us and the object, as well as by the manner in which light is\nreflected from the object in the direction of the eye. The intervening\n",
        "91": "air alters colours unless it is perfectly clear, and any strong\nreflection will alter them completely. Thus the colour we see is a\nresult of the ray as it reaches the eye, and not simply a property of\nthe object from which the ray comes.

Exactly similar arguments\nwill apply to other sense-data.\nIt remains to ask whether there are any general philosophical arguments\nenabling us to say that, if matter is real, it must be of such and such\na nature. As explained above, very many philosophers, perhaps most, have\n",

IDEALISM\n",
        "95": "The word 'idealism' is used by different philosophers in somewhat\ndifferent senses.

        "96": "that even the briefest survey of philosophy must give some account of\nit.\nThose who are unaccustomed to philosophical speculation may be inclined\nto dismiss such a doctrine as obviously absurd. There is no doubt that\ncommon sense regards tables and chairs and the sun and moon and material\nobjects generally as something radically different from minds and the\ncontents of minds, and as having an existence which might continue if\nminds ceased. We think of matter as having existed long before there\n",
        "97": "were any minds, and it is hard to think of it as a mere product of\nmental activity. But whether true or false, idealism is not to be\ndismissed as obviously absurd.\nWe have seen that, even if physical objects do have an independent\nexistence, they must differ very widely from sense-data, and can only\nhave a _correspondence_ with sense-data, in the same sort of way in\nwhich a catalogue has a correspondence with the things catalogued. Hence\n",
        "98": "common sense leaves us completely in the dark as to the true intrinsic\nnature of physical objects, and if there were good reason to regard them\nas mental, we could not legitimately reject this opinion merely because\nit strikes us as strange. The truth about physical objects _must_ be\nstrange. It may be unattainable, but if any philosopher believes that\nhe has attained it, the fact that what he offers as the truth is strange\nought not to be made a ground of objection to his opinion.\n",
        "99": "The grounds on which idealism is advocated are generally grounds derived\nfrom the theory of knowledge, that is to say, from a discussion of the\nconditions which things must satisfy in order that we may be able to\nknow them. The first serious attempt to establish idealism on such\ngrounds was that of Bishop Berkeley. He proved first, by arguments which\nwere largely valid, that our sense-data cannot be supposed to have an\nexistence independent of us, but must be, in part at least, 'in' the\nmind, in the sense that their existence would not continue if there were\nno seeing or hearing or touching or smelling or tasting. So far, his\n",
        "100": "contention was almost certainly valid, even if some of his arguments\nwere not so. But he went on to argue that sense-data were the only\nthings of whose existence our perceptions could assure us; and that\nto be known is to be 'in' a mind, and therefore to be mental. Hence he\nconcluded that nothing can ever be known except what is in some mind,\nand that whatever is known without being in my mind must be in some\nother mind.\n",
        "101": "In order to understand his argument, it is necessary to understand his\nuse of the word 'idea'. He gives the name 'idea' to anything which\nis _immediately_ known, as, for example, sense-data are known. Thus a\nparticular colour which we see is an idea; so is a voice which we hear,\nand so on. But the term is not wholly confined to sense-data. There will\n",
        "102": "also be things remembered or imagined, for with such things also we have\nimmediate acquaintance at the moment of remembering or imagining.

        "103": "tree consists of ideas in his sense of the word, and he argues that\nthere is not the slightest ground for supposing that there is anything\nreal about the tree except what is perceived. Its being, he says,\nconsists in being perceived: in the Latin of the schoolmen its '_esse_'\nis '_percipi_'. He fully admits that the tree must continue to exist\neven when we shut our eyes or when no human being is near it. But this\n",
        "104": "continued existence, he says, is due to the fact that God continues to\nperceive it; the 'real' tree, which corresponds to what we called the\nphysical object, consists of ideas in the mind of God, ideas more or\nless like those we have when we see the tree, but differing in the fact\nthat they are permanent in God's mind so long as the tree continues\nto exist. All our perceptions, according to him, consist in a\npartial participation in God's perceptions, and it is because of this\nparticipation that different people see more or less the same tree. Thus\napart from minds and their ideas there is nothing in the world, nor is\nit possible that anything else should ever be known, since whatever is\nknown is necessarily an idea.\n",
        "105": "There are in this argument a good many fallacies which have been\nimportant in the history of philosophy, and which it will be as well to\nbring to light. In the first place, there is a confusion engendered by\nthe use of the word 'idea'. We think of an idea as essentially something\nin somebody's mind, and thus when we are told that a tree consists\nentirely of ideas, it is natural to suppose that, if so, the tree\nmust be entirely in minds. But the notion of being 'in' the mind is\n",
        "106": "ambiguous. We speak of bearing a person in mind, not meaning that the\nperson is in our minds, but that a thought of him is in our minds. When\na man says that some business he had to arrange went clean out of his\nmind, he does not mean to imply that the business itself was ever in his\nmind, but only that a thought of the business was formerly in his mind,\nbut afterwards ceased to be in his mind. And so when Berkeley says that\n",
        "107": "the tree must be in our minds if we can know it, all that he really has\na right to say is that a thought of the tree must be in our minds. To\nargue that the tree itself must be in our minds is like arguing that a\nperson whom we bear in mind is himself in our minds. This confusion\nmay seem too gross to have been really committed by any competent\nphilosopher, but various attendant circumstances rendered it possible.\n",
        "108": "In order to see how it was possible, we must go more deeply into the\nquestion as to the nature of ideas.\nBefore taking up the general question of the nature of ideas, we must\ndisentangle two entirely separate questions which arise concerning\nsense-data and physical objects.

But this is an entirely different point\n",
        "109": "from the one by which Berkeley seeks to prove that whatever can be\nimmediately known must be in a mind.

This is what Berkeley believes himself to have done. It\n",
        "110": "is this question, and not our previous question as to the difference\nbetween sense-data and the physical object, that must now concern us.\nTaking the word 'idea' in Berkeley's sense, there are two quite distinct\nthings to be considered whenever an idea is before the mind.

We are all convinced that the sun will rise\n",

Of course it might be doubted whether we are quite certain\n",

If this were so, we should be\ninvolved in a definite contradiction if we attempted to deny anything\nthat could be known _a priori_.

We can\nbe sure, he says, that anything we shall ever experience must show the\ncharacteristics affirmed of it in our _a priori_ knowledge, because\nthese characteristics are due to our own nature, and therefore\nnothing can ever come into our experience without acquiring these\ncharacteristics.\nThe physical object, which he calls the 'thing in itself',(1) he regards\nas essentially unknowable; what can be known is the object as we have it\nin experience, which he calls the 'phenomenon'.

Thus, for example, if a tree\n",

This common nature, in\nvirtue of which they are all just, will be justice itself, the pure\nessence the admixture of which with facts of ordinary life produces the\nmultiplicity of just acts. Similarly with any other word which may be\n",
        "280": "applicable to common facts, such as 'whiteness' for example. The word\nwill be applicable to a number of particular things because they all\nparticipate in a common nature or essence. This pure essence is what\nPlato calls an 'idea' or 'form'. (It must not be supposed that 'ideas',\n",
        "281": "in his sense, exist in minds, though they may be apprehended by minds.)\nThe 'idea' _justice_ is not identical with anything that is just: it is\nsomething other than particular things, which particular things partake\nof. Not being particular, it cannot itself exist in the world of sense.\nMoreover it is not fleeting or changeable like the things of sense: it\nis eternally itself, immutable and indestructible.\n",
        "282": "Thus Plato is led to a supra-sensible world, more real than the common\nworld of sense, the unchangeable world of ideas, which alone gives to\nthe world of sense whatever pale reflection of reality may belong to it.\nThe truly real world, for Plato, is the world of ideas; for whatever\nwe may attempt to say about things in the world of sense, we can only\nsucceed in saying that they participate in such and such ideas, which,\ntherefore, constitute all their character. Hence it is easy to pass\non into a mysticism. We may hope, in a mystic illumination, to see the\n",
        "283": "ideas as we see objects of sense; and we may imagine that the ideas\nexist in heaven. These mystical developments are very natural, but the\nbasis of the theory is in logic, and it is as based in logic that we\nhave to consider it.\nThe word 'idea' has acquired, in the course of time, many associations\nwhich are quite misleading when applied to Plato's 'ideas'. We shall\n",
        "284": "therefore use the word 'universal' instead of the word 'idea', to\ndescribe what Plato meant. The essence of the sort of entity that Plato\nmeant is that it is opposed to the particular things that are given in\nsensation. We speak of whatever is given in sensation, or is of the same\nnature as things given in sensation, as a _particular_; by opposition\nto this, a _universal_ will be anything which may be shared by many\nparticulars, and has those characteristics which, as we saw, distinguish\njustice and whiteness from just acts and white things.\n",
        "285": "When we examine common words, we find that, broadly speaking, proper\nnames stand for particulars, while other substantives, adjectives,\nprepositions, and verbs stand for universals. Pronouns stand for\nparticulars, but are ambiguous: it is only by the context or the\ncircumstances that we know what particulars they stand for. The word\n'now' stands for a particular, namely the present moment; but like\npronouns, it stands for an ambiguous particular, because the present is\nalways changing.\n",
        "286": "It will be seen that no sentence can be made up without at least one\nword which denotes a universal. The nearest approach would be some such\nstatement as 'I like this'.

We\ndo not naturally dwell upon those words in a sentence which do not stand\nfor particulars; and if we are forced to dwell upon a word which stands\nfor a universal, we naturally think of it as standing for some one of\nthe particulars that come under the universal. When, for example, we\n",

Hence we succeed in avoiding all notice of universals as\nsuch, until the study of philosophy forces them upon our attention.\nEven among philosophers, we may say, broadly, that only those universals\nwhich are named by adjectives or substantives have been much or often\nrecognized, while those named by verbs and prepositions have been\nusually overlooked.

This\nconsideration will occupy us in the following chapter, where we shall\nfind that it solves the problem of _a priori_ knowledge, from which we\nwere first led to consider universals.\n",
        "313": "CHAPTER X. ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF UNIVERSALS\nIn regard to one man's knowledge at a given time, universals, like\nparticulars, may be divided into those known by acquaintance, those\nknown only by description, and those not known either by acquaintance or\nby description.\nLet us consider first the knowledge of universals by acquaintance. It is\n",
        "314": "obvious, to begin with, that we are acquainted with such universals as\nwhite, red, black, sweet, sour, loud, hard, etc., i.e. with qualities\nwhich are exemplified in sense-data. When we see a white patch, we are\nacquainted, in the first instance, with the particular patch; but by\nseeing many white patches, we easily learn to abstract the whiteness\nwhich they all have in common, and in learning to do this we are\nlearning to be acquainted with whiteness. A similar process will make us\n",
        "315": "acquainted with any other universal of the same sort. Universals of this\nsort may be called 'sensible qualities'. They can be apprehended with\nless effort of abstraction than any others, and they seem less removed\nfrom particulars than other universals are.\n",
        "316": "We come next to relations. The easiest relations to apprehend are those\nwhich hold between the different parts of a single complex sense-datum.\nFor example, I can see at a glance the whole of the page on which I\nam writing; thus the whole page is included in one sense-datum. But I\n",
        "317": "perceive that some parts of the page are to the left of other parts,\nand some parts are above other parts. The process of abstraction in this\ncase seems to proceed somewhat as follows: I see successively a number\nof sense-data in which one part is to the left of another; I perceive,\nas in the case of different white patches, that all these sense-data\nhave something in common, and by abstraction I find that what they have\nin common is a certain relation between their parts, namely the relation\nwhich I call 'being to the left of'. In this way I become acquainted\nwith the universal relation.\n",
        "318": "In like manner I become aware of the relation of before and after in\ntime. Suppose I hear a chime of bells: when the last bell of the chime\nsounds, I can retain the whole chime before my mind, and I can perceive\nthat the earlier bells came before the later ones. Also in memory I\nperceive that what I am remembering came before the present time. From\n",
        "319": "either of these sources I can abstract the universal relation of before\nand after, just as I abstracted the universal relation 'being to the\nleft of'. Thus time-relations, like space-relations, are among those\nwith which we are acquainted.\nAnother relation with which we become acquainted in much the same way is\nresemblance. If I see simultaneously two shades of green, I can see\n",
        "320": "that they resemble each other; if I also see a shade of red: at the same\ntime, I can see that the two greens have more resemblance to each other\nthan either has to the red. In this way I become acquainted with the\nuniversal _resemblance_ or _similarity_.\nBetween universals, as between particulars, there are relations of which\nwe may be immediately aware. We have just seen that we can perceive\n",
        "321": "that the resemblance between two shades of green is greater than the\nresemblance between a shade of red and a shade of green. Here we are\ndealing with a relation, namely 'greater than', between two relations.\nOur knowledge of such relations, though it requires more power of\nabstraction than is required for perceiving the qualities of sense-data,\nappears to be equally immediate, and (at least in some cases) equally\nindubitable. Thus there is immediate knowledge concerning universals as\n",
        "322": "well as concerning sense-data.\nReturning now to the problem of _a priori_ knowledge, which we left\nunsolved when we began the consideration of universals, we find\nourselves in a position to deal with it in a much more satisfactory\nmanner than was possible before. Let us revert to the proposition 'two\nand two are four'. It is fairly obvious, in view of what has been said,\n",
        "323": "that this proposition states a relation between the universal 'two' and\nthe universal 'four'. This suggests a proposition which we shall\nnow endeavour to establish: namely, _All _a priori_ knowledge deals\nexclusively with the relations of universals_. This proposition is\nof great importance, and goes a long way towards solving our previous\ndifficulties concerning _a priori_ knowledge.\n",
        "324": "The only case in which it might seem, at first sight, as if our\nproposition were untrue, is the case in which an _a priori_ proposition\nstates that _all_ of one class of particulars belong to some other\nclass, or (what comes to the same thing) that _all_ particulars having\nsome one property also have some other. In this case it might seem\nas though we were dealing with the particulars that have the property\nrather than with the property. The proposition 'two and two are four' is\nreally a case in point, for this may be stated in the form 'any two\nand any other two are four', or 'any collection formed of two twos is a\ncollection of four'. If we can show that such statements as this really\n",
        "325": "deal only with universals, our proposition may be regarded as proved.\nOne way of discovering what a proposition deals with is to ask ourselves\nwhat words we must understand--in other words, what objects we must be\nacquainted with--in order to see what the proposition means. As soon as\nwe see what the proposition means, even if we do not yet know whether\nit is true or false, it is evident that we must have acquaintance with\nwhatever is really dealt with by the proposition. By applying this test,\n",
        "326": "it appears that many propositions which might seem to be concerned with\nparticulars are really concerned only with universals. In the special\ncase of 'two and two are four', even when we interpret it as meaning\n'any collection formed of two twos is a collection of four', it is plain\nthat we can understand the proposition, i.e. we can see what it is that\nit asserts, as soon as we know what is meant by 'collection' and 'two'\nand 'four'. It is quite unnecessary to know all the couples in the\n",
        "327": "world: if it were necessary, obviously we could never understand the\nproposition, since the couples are infinitely numerous and therefore\ncannot all be known to us. Thus although our general statement _implies_\nstatements about particular couples, _as soon as we know that there are\nsuch particular couples_, yet it does not itself assert or imply that\nthere are such particular couples, and thus fails to make any statement\nwhatever about any actual particular couple. The statement made is about\n'couple', the universal, and not about this or that couple.\n",
        "328": "Thus the statement 'two and two are four' deals exclusively with\nuniversals, and therefore may be known by anybody who is acquainted\nwith the universals concerned and can perceive the relation between them\nwhich the statement asserts. It must be taken as a fact, discovered\nby reflecting upon our knowledge, that we have the power of sometimes\nperceiving such relations between universals, and therefore of sometimes\nknowing general _a priori_ propositions such as those of arithmetic and\nlogic. The thing that seemed mysterious, when we formerly considered\nsuch knowledge, was that it seemed to anticipate and control experience.\n",
        "329": "This, however, we can now see to have been an error. _No_ fact\nconcerning anything capable of being experienced can be known\nindependently of experience. We know _a priori_ that two things and two\nother things together make four things, but we do _not_ know _a priori_\nthat if Brown and Jones are two, and Robinson and Smith are two, then\nBrown and Jones and Robinson and Smith are four. The reason is that this\n",
        "330": "proposition cannot be understood at all unless we know that there are\nsuch people as Brown and Jones and Robinson and Smith, and this we can\nonly know by experience. Hence, although our general proposition is _a\npriori_, all its applications to actual particulars involve experience\nand therefore contain an empirical element. In this way what seemed\nmysterious in our _a priori_ knowledge is seen to have been based upon\nan error.\n",
        "331": "It will serve to make the point clearer if we contrast our genuine _a\npriori_ judgement with an empirical generalization, such as 'all men are\nmortals'. Here as before, we can _understand_ what the proposition\nmeans as soon as we understand the universals involved, namely _man_ and\n_mortal_. It is obviously unnecessary to have an individual acquaintance\nwith the whole human race in order to understand what our proposition\nmeans. Thus the difference between an _a priori_ general proposition\n",
        "332": "and an empirical generalization does not come in the _meaning_ of the\nproposition; it comes in the nature of the _evidence_ for it. In the\nempirical case, the evidence consists in the particular instances.\nWe believe that all men are mortal because we know that there are\ninnumerable instances of men dying, and no instances of their living\nbeyond a certain age. We do not believe it because we see a connexion\n",
        "333": "between the universal _man_ and the universal _mortal_. It is true that\nif physiology can prove, assuming the general laws that govern living\nbodies, that no living organism can last for ever, that gives a\nconnexion between _man_ and _mortality_ which would enable us to assert\nour proposition without appealing to the special evidence of _men_\ndying. But that only means that our generalization has been subsumed\nunder a wider generalization, for which the evidence is still of the\nsame kind, though more extensive. The progress of science is constantly\n",
        "334": "producing such subsumptions, and therefore giving a constantly wider\ninductive basis for scientific generalizations. But although this gives\na greater _degree_ of certainty, it does not give a different _kind_:\nthe ultimate ground remains inductive, i.e. derived from instances, and\nnot an _a priori_ connexion of universals such as we have in logic and\narithmetic.\n",
        "335": "Two opposite points are to be observed concerning _a priori_ general\npropositions. The first is that, if many particular instances are known,\nour general proposition may be arrived at in the first instance by\ninduction, and the connexion of universals may be only subsequently\nperceived. For example, it is known that if we draw perpendiculars\nto the sides of a triangle from the opposite angles, all three\nperpendiculars meet in a point. It would be quite possible to be first\n",
        "336": "led to this proposition by actually drawing perpendiculars in many\ncases, and finding that they always met in a point; this experience\nmight lead us to look for the general proof and find it. Such cases are\ncommon in the experience of every mathematician.\nThe other point is more interesting, and of more philosophical\nimportance. It is, that we may sometimes know a general proposition in\n",
        "337": "cases where we do not know a single instance of it. Take such a case as\nthe following: We know that any two numbers can be multiplied together,\nand will give a third called their _product_.

Hence it follows that\nthere are pairs of integers which never have been and never will be\nthought of by human beings, and that all of them deal with integers the\nproduct of which is over 100.

        "339": "proposition of which the truth is undeniable, and yet, from the very\nnature of the case, we can never give an instance; because any two\nnumbers we may think of are excluded by the terms of the proposition.\nThis possibility, of knowledge of general propositions of which no\ninstance can be given, is often denied, because it is not perceived\nthat the knowledge of such propositions only requires a knowledge of the\nrelations of universals, and does not require any knowledge of instances\nof the universals in question. Yet the knowledge of such general\npropositions is quite vital to a great deal of what is generally\nadmitted to be known. For example, we saw, in our early chapters,\n",
        "340": "that knowledge of physical objects, as opposed to sense-data, is only\nobtained by an inference, and that they are not things with which we are\nacquainted.

Starting with the\n",
        "351": "common beliefs of daily life, we can be driven back from point to point,\nuntil we come to some general principle, or some instance of a general\nprinciple, which seems luminously evident, and is not itself capable\nof being deduced from anything more evident. In most questions of\ndaily life, such as whether our food is likely to be nourishing and not\npoisonous, we shall be driven back to the inductive principle, which we\ndiscussed in Chapter VI. But beyond that, there seems to be no further\nregress. The principle itself is constantly used in our reasoning,\n",
        "352": "sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously; but there is no\nreasoning which, starting from some simpler self-evident principle,\nleads us to the principle of induction as its conclusion. And the same\nholds for other logical principles. Their truth is evident to us, and we\nemploy them in constructing demonstrations; but they themselves, or at\nleast some of them, are incapable of demonstration.\n",
        "353": "Self-evidence, however, is not confined to those among general\nprinciples which are incapable of proof. When a certain number of\nlogical principles have been admitted, the rest can be deduced from\nthem; but the propositions deduced are often just as self-evident as\nthose that were assumed without proof. All arithmetic, moreover, can\nbe deduced from the general principles of logic, yet the simple\npropositions of arithmetic, such as 'two and two are four', are just as\nself-evident as the principles of logic.\n",
        "354": "It would seem, also, though this is more disputable, that there are some\nself-evident ethical principles, such as 'we ought to pursue what is\ngood'.\nIt should be observed that, in all cases of general principles,\nparticular instances, dealing with familiar things, are more evident\nthan the general principle.

A\nparticular patch of colour which I see, for example, simply exists: it\nis not the sort of thing that is true or false.

Thus whatever self-evident truths\nmay be obtained from our senses must be different from the sense-data\nfrom which they are obtained.\nIt would seem that there are two kinds of self-evident truths of\nperception, though perhaps in the last analysis the two kinds may\ncoalesce. First, there is the kind which simply asserts the _existence_\n",
        "359": "of the sense-datum, without in any way analysing it. We see a patch\nof red, and we judge 'there is such-and-such a patch of red', or more\nstrictly 'there is that'; this is one kind of intuitive judgement of\nperception. The other kind arises when the object of sense is complex,\nand we subject it to some degree of analysis. If, for instance, we see a\n",
        "360": "_round_ patch of red, we may judge 'that patch of red is round'. This is\nagain a judgement of perception, but it differs from our previous kind.\nIn our present kind we have a single sense-datum which has both colour\nand shape: the colour is red and the shape is round. Our judgement\n",
        "361": "analyses the datum into colour and shape, and then recombines them by\nstating that the red colour is round in shape. Another example of this\nkind of judgement is 'this is to the right of that', where 'this'\nand 'that' are seen simultaneously. In this kind of judgement the\nsense-datum contains constituents which have some relation to each\nother, and the judgement asserts that these constituents have this\nrelation.\n",
        "362": "Another class of intuitive judgements, analogous to those of sense and\nyet quite distinct from them, are judgements of _memory_. There is some\ndanger of confusion as to the nature of memory, owing to the fact that\nmemory of an object is apt to be accompanied by an image of the object,\nand yet the image cannot be what constitutes memory. This is easily seen\nby merely noticing that the image is in the present, whereas what is\nremembered is known to be in the past. Moreover, we are certainly able\n",
        "363": "to some extent to compare our image with the object remembered, so\nthat we often know, within somewhat wide limits, how far our image is\naccurate; but this would be impossible, unless the object, as opposed to\nthe image, were in some way before the mind. Thus the essence of memory\nis not constituted by the image, but by having immediately before the\nmind an object which is recognized as past. But for the fact of memory\nin this sense, we should not know that there ever was a past at all,\nnor should we be able to understand the word 'past', any more than a man\nborn blind can understand the word 'light'. Thus there must be intuitive\n",
        "364": "judgements of memory, and it is upon them, ultimately, that all our\nknowledge of the past depends.\nThe case of memory, however, raises a difficulty, for it is notoriously\nfallacious, and thus throws doubt on the trustworthiness of intuitive\njudgements in general. This difficulty is no light one. But let us\nfirst narrow its scope as far as possible. Broadly speaking, memory is\n",
        "365": "trustworthy in proportion to the vividness of the experience and to its\nnearness in time. If the house next door was struck by lightning half a\nminute ago, my memory of what I saw and heard will be so reliable that\nit would be preposterous to doubt whether there had been a flash at\nall. And the same applies to less vivid experiences, so long as they are\nrecent. I am absolutely certain that half a minute ago I was sitting in\n",
        "366": "the same chair in which I am sitting now. Going backward over the day,\nI find things of which I am quite certain, other things of which I am\nalmost certain, other things of which I can become certain by thought\nand by calling up attendant circumstances, and some things of which I\nam by no means certain. I am quite certain that I ate my breakfast this\nmorning, but if I were as indifferent to my breakfast as a philosopher\nshould be, I should be doubtful. As to the conversation at breakfast,\n",
        "367": "I can recall some of it easily, some with an effort, some only with a\nlarge element of doubt, and some not at all. Thus there is a continual\ngradation in the degree of self-evidence of what I remember, and a\ncorresponding gradation in the trustworthiness of my memory.\nThus the first answer to the difficulty of fallacious memory is to say\nthat memory has degrees of self-evidence, and that these correspond\nto the degrees of its trustworthiness, reaching a limit of perfect\nself-evidence and perfect trustworthiness in our memory of events which\nare recent and vivid.\n",
        "368": "It would seem, however, that there are cases of very firm belief in a\nmemory which is wholly false. It is probable that, in these cases, what\nis really remembered, in the sense of being immediately before the mind,\nis something other than what is falsely believed in, though something\ngenerally associated with it. George IV is said to have at last believed\nthat he was at the battle of Waterloo, because he had so often said that\nhe was. In this case, what was immediately remembered was his repeated\n",
        "369": "assertion; the belief in what he was asserting (if it existed) would\nbe produced by association with the remembered assertion, and would\ntherefore not be a genuine case of memory. It would seem that cases of\nfallacious memory can probably all be dealt with in this way, i.e. they\ncan be shown to be not cases of memory in the strict sense at all.\n",
        "370": "One important point about self-evidence is made clear by the case of\nmemory, and that is, that self-evidence has degrees: it is not a quality\nwhich is simply present or absent, but a quality which may be more or\nless present, in gradations ranging from absolute certainty down to an\nalmost imperceptible faintness. Truths of perception and some of the\nprinciples of logic have the very highest degree of self-evidence;\ntruths of immediate memory have an almost equally high degree. The\ninductive principle has less self-evidence than some of the other\nprinciples of logic, such as 'what follows from a true premiss must be\ntrue'. Memories have a diminishing self-evidence as they become remoter\n",
        "371": "and fainter; the truths of logic and mathematics have (broadly speaking)\nless self-evidence as they become more complicated. Judgements of\nintrinsic ethical or aesthetic value are apt to have some self-evidence,\nbut not much.\nDegrees of self-evidence are important in the theory of knowledge,\nsince, if propositions may (as seems likely) have some degree of\nself-evidence without being true, it will not be necessary to abandon\nall connexion between self-evidence and truth, but merely to say that,\nwhere there is a conflict, the more self-evident proposition is to be\nretained and the less self-evident rejected.\n",
        "372": "It seems, however, highly probable that two different notions are\ncombined in 'self-evidence' as above explained; that one of them,\nwhich corresponds to the highest degree of self-evidence, is really an\ninfallible guarantee of truth, while the other, which corresponds to\nall the other degrees, does not give an infallible guarantee, but only a\ngreater or less presumption. This, however, is only a suggestion, which\nwe cannot as yet develop further.

        "375": "what is true. We know that on very many subjects different people\nhold different and incompatible opinions: hence some beliefs must be\nerroneous. Since erroneous beliefs are often held just as strongly\nas true beliefs, it becomes a difficult question how they are to be\ndistinguished from true beliefs. How are we to know, in a given case,\n",
        "376": "that our belief is not erroneous? This is a question of the very\ngreatest difficulty, to which no completely satisfactory answer is\npossible. There is, however, a preliminary question which is rather less\ndifficult, and that is: What do we _mean_ by truth and falsehood? It is\n",
        "377": "this preliminary question which is to be considered in this chapter. In\nthis chapter we are not asking how we can know whether a belief is true\nor false: we are asking what is meant by the question whether a belief\nis true or false. It is to be hoped that a clear answer to this question\nmay help us to obtain an answer to the question what beliefs are\ntrue, but for the present we ask only 'What is truth?' and 'What is\n",
        "378": "falsehood?' not 'What beliefs are true?' and 'What beliefs are false?'\nIt is very important to keep these different questions entirely\nseparate, since any confusion between them is sure to produce an answer\nwhich is not really applicable to either.\nThere are three points to observe in the attempt to discover the nature\nof truth, three requisites which any theory must fulfil.\n",
        "379": "(1) Our theory of truth must be such as to admit of its opposite,\nfalsehood. A good many philosophers have failed adequately to satisfy\nthis condition: they have constructed theories according to which all\nour thinking ought to have been true, and have then had the greatest\ndifficulty in finding a place for falsehood. In this respect our theory\nof belief must differ from our theory of acquaintance, since in the case\nof acquaintance it was not necessary to take account of any opposite.\n",
        "380": "(2) It seems fairly evident that if there were no beliefs there could\nbe no falsehood, and no truth either, in the sense in which truth is\ncorrelative to falsehood. If we imagine a world of mere matter, there\nwould be no room for falsehood in such a world, and although it would\ncontain what may be called 'facts', it would not contain any truths, in\nthe sense in which truths are things of the same kind as falsehoods.\nIn fact, truth and falsehood are properties of beliefs and statements:\nhence a world of mere matter, since it would contain no beliefs or\nstatements, would also contain no truth or falsehood.\n",
        "381": "(3) But, as against what we have just said, it is to be observed that\nthe truth or falsehood of a belief always depends upon something which\nlies outside the belief itself. If I believe that Charles I died on the\nscaffold, I believe truly, not because of any intrinsic quality of my\nbelief, which could be discovered by merely examining the belief, but\nbecause of an historical event which happened two and a half centuries\nago. If I believe that Charles I died in his bed, I believe falsely: no\ndegree of vividness in my belief, or of care in arriving at it, prevents\nit from being false, again because of what happened long ago, and not\nbecause of any intrinsic property of my belief. Hence, although truth\n",
        "382": "and falsehood are properties of beliefs, they are properties dependent\nupon the relations of the beliefs to other things, not upon any internal\nquality of the beliefs.\nThe third of the above requisites leads us to adopt the view--which has\non the whole been commonest among philosophers--that truth consists in\nsome form of correspondence between belief and fact. It is, however, by\nno means an easy matter to discover a form of correspondence to which\nthere are no irrefutable objections. By this partly--and partly by the\n",
        "383": "feeling that, if truth consists in a correspondence of thought with\nsomething outside thought, thought can never know when truth has been\nattained--many philosophers have been led to try to find some definition\nof truth which shall not consist in relation to something wholly outside\nbelief. The most important attempt at a definition of this sort is the\ntheory that truth consists in _coherence_. It is said that the mark of\nfalsehood is failure to cohere in the body of our beliefs, and that it\nis the essence of a truth to form part of the completely rounded system\nwhich is The Truth.\n",
        "384": "There is, however, a great difficulty in this view, or rather two great\ndifficulties. The first is that there is no reason to suppose that\nonly _one_ coherent body of beliefs is possible. It may be that, with\nsufficient imagination, a novelist might invent a past for the world\nthat would perfectly fit on to what we know, and yet be quite different\nfrom the real past. In more scientific matters, it is certain that there\n",

Thus, for example, it is\npossible that life is one long dream, and that the outer world has only\nthat degree of reality that the objects of dreams have; but although\nsuch a view does not seem inconsistent with known facts, there is no\nreason to prefer it to the common-sense view, according to which other\npeople and things do really exist. Thus coherence as the definition\n",
        "386": "of truth fails because there is no proof that there can be only one\ncoherent system.\nThe other objection to this definition of truth is that it assumes the\nmeaning of 'coherence' known, whereas, in fact, 'coherence' presupposes\nthe truth of the laws of logic. Two propositions are coherent when both\nmay be true, and are incoherent when one at least must be false. Now in\n",

For example, the two\npropositions, 'this tree is a beech' and 'this tree is not a beech',\nare not coherent, because of the law of contradiction. But if the law of\ncontradiction itself were subjected to the test of coherence, we should\nfind that, if we choose to suppose it false, nothing will any longer\nbe incoherent with anything else. Thus the laws of logic supply the\n",

It remains to define precisely what we mean by\n",
        "389": "'fact', and what is the nature of the correspondence which must subsist\nbetween belief and fact, in order that belief may be true.\nIn accordance with our three requisites, we have to seek a theory of\ntruth which (1) allows truth to have an opposite, namely falsehood, (2)\nmakes truth a property of beliefs, but (3) makes it a property wholly\ndependent upon the relation of the beliefs to outside things.\nThe necessity of allowing for falsehood makes it impossible to regard\nbelief as a relation of the mind to a single object, which could be said\nto be what is believed. If belief were so regarded, we should find that,\n",

Othello believes falsely that Desdemona loves Cassio.

Hence it will be better to seek for a theory of belief which\n",
        "392": "does not make it consist in a relation of the mind to a single object.\nIt is common to think of relations as though they always held between\ntwo terms, but in fact this is not always the case. Some relations\ndemand three terms, some four, and so on. Take, for instance, the\n",

Similarly _jealousy_ requires\n",
        "394": "three people: there can be no such relation that does not involve three\nat least. Such a proposition as 'A wishes B to promote C's marriage with\nD' involves a relation of four terms; that is to say, A and B and C and\nD all come in, and the relation involved cannot be expressed otherwise\nthan in a form involving all four. Instances might be multiplied\nindefinitely, but enough has been said to show that there are relations\nwhich require more than two terms before they can occur.\n",
        "395": "The relation involved in _judging_ or _believing_ must, if falsehood is\nto be duly allowed for, be taken to be a relation between several terms,\nnot between two. When Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio, he\nmust not have before his mind a single object, 'Desdemona's love for\nCassio', or 'that Desdemona loves Cassio ', for that would require that\nthere should be objective falsehoods, which subsist independently of\nany minds; and this, though not logically refutable, is a theory to be\navoided if possible. Thus it is easier to account for falsehood if\nwe take judgement to be a relation in which the mind and the various\nobjects concerned all occur severally; that is to say, Desdemona and\nloving and Cassio must all be terms in the relation which subsists when\nOthello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio. This relation, therefore,\n",

When we say that it is a relation of four terms, we do not\nmean that Othello has a certain relation to Desdemona, and has the same\nrelation to loving and also to Cassio. This may be true of some other\nrelation than believing; but believing, plainly, is not a relation which\nOthello has to _each_ of the three terms concerned, but to _all_ of\nthem together: there is only one example of the relation of believing\ninvolved, but this one example knits together four terms. Thus the\n",

An _act_ of belief or of judgement is the occurrence\nbetween certain terms at some particular time, of the relation of\nbelieving or judging.\n",
        "398": "We are now in a position to understand what it is that distinguishes a\ntrue judgement from a false one. For this purpose we will adopt certain\ndefinitions. In every act of judgement there is a mind which judges, and\nthere are terms concerning which it judges. We will call the mind the\n",

Thus,\nwhen Othello judges that Desdemona loves Cassio, Othello is the subject,\nwhile the objects are Desdemona and loving and Cassio. The subject and\nthe objects together are called the _constituents_ of the judgement.\n",
        "400": "It will be observed that the relation of judging has what is called a\n'sense' or 'direction'.

In this\n",

Wherever there is a relation\nwhich relates certain terms, there is a complex object formed of the\nunion of those terms; and conversely, wherever there is a complex\nobject, there is a relation which relates its constituents.

But\nthis relation, as it occurs in the act of believing, is not the relation\nwhich creates the unity of the complex whole consisting of the subject\nand the objects. The relation 'loving', as it occurs in the act of\nbelieving, is one of the objects--it is a brick in the structure, not\nthe cement. The cement is the relation 'believing'. When the belief is\n",

Assuming, for the sake of\ndefiniteness, that the objects of the belief are two terms and a\nrelation, the terms being put in a certain order by the 'sense' of\nthe believing, then if the two terms in that order are united by the\nrelation into a complex, the belief is true; if not, it is false.

Judging or believing is a certain complex unity of which a mind is\na constituent; if the remaining constituents, taken in the order which\nthey have in the belief, form a complex unity, then the belief is true;\nif not, it is false.\nThus although truth and falsehood are properties of beliefs, yet they\nare in a sense extrinsic properties, for the condition of the truth of\na belief is something not involving beliefs, or (in general) any mind\nat all, but only the _objects_ of the belief. A mind, which believes,\n",

Hence we account simultaneously for the two\nfacts that beliefs (a) depend on minds for their _existence_, (b) do not\ndepend on minds for their _truth_.\n",
        "410": "We may restate our theory as follows: If we take such a belief as\n'Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio', we will call Desdemona\nand Cassio the _object-terms_, and loving the _object-relation_. If\nthere is a complex unity 'Desdemona's love for Cassio', consisting of\nthe object-terms related by the object-relation in the same order as\nthey have in the belief, then this complex unity is called the _fact\ncorresponding to the belief_. Thus a belief is true when there is a\ncorresponding fact, and is false when there is no corresponding fact.\n",
        "411": "It will be seen that minds do not _create_ truth or falsehood. They\ncreate beliefs, but when once the beliefs are created, the mind cannot\nmake them true or false, except in the special case where they concern\nfuture things which are within the power of the person believing, such\nas catching trains.

To take a very trivial\ninstance: If a man believes that the late Prime Minister's last name\nbegan with a B, he believes what is true, since the late Prime Minister\nwas Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman. But if he believes that Mr. Balfour\nwas the late Prime Minister, he will still believe that the late Prime\nMinister's last name began with a B, yet this belief, though true,\nwould not be thought to constitute knowledge. If a newspaper, by an\n",

But in spite of\nthe truth of their belief, they cannot be said to have knowledge. Thus\nit is clear that a true belief is not knowledge when it is deduced from\na false belief.\n",
        "417": "In like manner, a true belief cannot be called knowledge when it is\ndeduced by a fallacious process of reasoning, even if the premisses from\nwhich it is deduced are true. If I know that all Greeks are men and that\nSocrates was a man, and I infer that Socrates was a Greek, I cannot be\nsaid to _know_ that Socrates was a Greek, because, although my premisses\nand my conclusion are true, the conclusion does not follow from the\npremisses.\nBut are we to say that nothing is knowledge except what is validly\ndeduced from true premisses? Obviously we cannot say this. Such a\n",

This, however, is a\ncircular definition: it assumes that we already know what is meant\nby 'known premisses'.

In this statement there is\nno formal defect, but it leaves the definition of _intuitive_ knowledge\nstill to seek.\nLeaving on one side, for the moment, the question of intuitive\nknowledge, let us consider the above suggested definition of derivative\nknowledge. The chief objection to it is that it unduly limits knowledge.\n",

If the newspapers\nannounce the death of the King, we are fairly well justified in\nbelieving that the King is dead, since this is the sort of announcement\nwhich would not be made if it were false. And we are quite amply\n",

So long as we\n",

Something may be done, however, to mitigate\n",
        "428": "the difficulties of the question.\nOur theory of truth, to begin with, supplies the possibility of\ndistinguishing certain truths as _self-evident_ in a sense which ensures\ninfallibility. When a belief is true, we said, there is a corresponding\nfact, in which the several objects of the belief form a single complex.\n",
        "429": "The belief is said to constitute _knowledge_ of this fact, provided\nit fulfils those further somewhat vague conditions which we have been\nconsidering in the present chapter. But in regard to any fact, besides\nthe knowledge constituted by belief, we may also have the kind of\nknowledge constituted by _perception_ (taking this word in its widest\npossible sense). For example, if you know the hour of the sunset,\nyou can at that hour know the fact that the sun is setting: this is\nknowledge of the fact by way of knowledge of _truths_; but you can also,\nif the weather is fine, look to the west and actually see the setting\nsun: you then know the same fact by the way of knowledge of _things_.\n",

Now it will be observed that the second way of\nknowing a complex fact, the way of acquaintance, is only possible when\nthere really is such a fact, while the first way, like all judgement,\nis liable to error.

These two kinds\ncan now be distinguished.\n",

When Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio, the\ncorresponding fact, if his belief were true, would be 'Desdemona's\nlove for Cassio'. This would be a fact with which no one could have\nacquaintance except Desdemona; hence in the sense of self-evidence that\nwe are considering, the truth that Desdemona loves Cassio (if it were\na truth) could only be self-evident to Desdemona. All mental facts, and\n",

In all cases\nwhere we know by acquaintance a complex fact consisting of certain terms\nin a certain relation, we say that the truth that these terms are so\nrelated has the first or absolute kind of self-evidence, and in these\ncases the judgement that the terms are so related _must_ be true. Thus\nthis sort of self-evidence is an absolute guarantee of truth.\n",
        "435": "But although this sort of self-evidence is an absolute guarantee of\ntruth, it does not enable us to be _absolutely_ certain, in the case of\nany given judgement, that the judgement in question is true. Suppose\nwe first perceive the sun shining, which is a complex fact, and thence\nproceed to make the judgement 'the sun is shining'. In passing from\nthe perception to the judgement, it is necessary to analyse the given\ncomplex fact: we have to separate out 'the sun' and 'shining' as\nconstituents of the fact. In this process it is possible to commit\n",

But if it does correspond (in the sense explained in the preceding\nchapter), then it _must_ be true.\nThe second sort of self-evidence will be that which belongs to\njudgements in the first instance, and is not derived from direct\nperception of a fact as a single complex whole.

We can be quite sure they are different shades of colour; but\nif the green colour is gradually altered to be more and more like the\nblue, becoming first a blue-green, then a greeny-blue, then blue,\nthere will come a moment when we are doubtful whether we can see any\ndifference, and then a moment when we know that we cannot see any\ndifference.

THE LIMITS OF PHILOSOPHICAL KNOWLEDGE\nIn all that we have said hitherto concerning philosophy, we have\nscarcely touched on many matters that occupy a great space in the\nwritings of most philosophers. Most philosophers--or, at any rate, very\nmany--profess to be able to prove, by _a priori_ metaphysical reasoning,\nsuch things as the fundamental dogmas of religion, the essential\nrationality of the universe, the illusoriness of matter, the unreality\nof all evil, and so on. There can be no doubt that the hope of finding\n",
        "447": "reason to believe such theses as these has been the chief inspiration of\nmany life-long students of philosophy. This hope, I believe, is vain. It\nwould seem that knowledge concerning the universe as a whole is not to\nbe obtained by metaphysics, and that the proposed proofs that, in virtue\nof the laws of logic such and such things _must_ exist and such and such\nothers cannot, are not capable of surviving a critical scrutiny. In\nthis chapter we shall briefly consider the kind of way in which such\nreasoning is attempted, with a view to discovering whether we can hope\nthat it may be valid.\n",
        "448": "The great representative, in modern times, of the kind of view which\nwe wish to examine, was Hegel (1770-1831). Hegel's philosophy is very\ndifficult, and commentators differ as to the true interpretation of it.\nAccording to the interpretation I shall adopt, which is that of many, if\nnot most, of the commentators and has the merit of giving an interesting\nand important type of philosophy, his main thesis is that everything\nshort of the Whole is obviously fragmentary, and obviously incapable of\nexisting without the complement supplied by the rest of the world. Just\n",
        "449": "as a comparative anatomist, from a single bone, sees what kind of animal\nthe whole must have been, so the metaphysician, according to Hegel,\nsees, from any one piece of reality, what the whole of reality must\nbe--at least in its large outlines. Every apparently separate piece of\nreality has, as it were, hooks which grapple it to the next piece;\nthe next piece, in turn, has fresh hooks, and so on, until the whole\nuniverse is reconstructed. This essential incompleteness appears,\naccording to Hegel, equally in the world of thought and in the world of\nthings. In the world of thought, if we take any idea which is\n",
        "450": "abstract or incomplete, we find, on examination, that if we forget\nits incompleteness, we become involved in contradictions; these\ncontradictions turn the idea in question into its opposite, or\nantithesis; and in order to escape, we have to find a new, less\nincomplete idea, which is the synthesis of our original idea and its\nantithesis. This new idea, though less incomplete than the idea we\nstarted with, will be found, nevertheless, to be still not wholly\ncomplete, but to pass into its antithesis, with which it must be\ncombined in a new synthesis. In this way Hegel advances until he reaches\nthe 'Absolute Idea', which, according to him, has no incompleteness,\nno opposite, and no need of further development. The Absolute Idea,\n",
        "451": "therefore, is adequate to describe Absolute Reality; but all lower ideas\nonly describe reality as it appears to a partial view, not as it is\nto one who simultaneously surveys the Whole. Thus Hegel reaches the\nconclusion that Absolute Reality forms one single harmonious system, not\nin space or time, not in any degree evil, wholly rational, and wholly\nspiritual. Any appearance to the contrary, in the world we know, can be\nproved logically--so he believes--to be entirely due to our fragmentary\npiecemeal view of the universe. If we saw the universe whole, as we may\n",
        "452": "suppose God sees it, space and time and matter and evil and all striving\nand struggling would disappear, and we should see instead an eternal\nperfect unchanging spiritual unity.\nIn this conception, there is undeniably something sublime, something to\nwhich we could wish to yield assent. Nevertheless, when the arguments\nin support of it are carefully examined, they appear to involve much\nconfusion and many unwarrantable assumptions. The fundamental tenet\n",
        "453": "upon which the system is built up is that what is incomplete must be not\nself-subsistent, but must need the support of other things before it can\nexist. It is held that whatever has relations to things outside itself\nmust contain some reference to those outside things in its own nature,\nand could not, therefore, be what it is if those outside things did not\nexist. A man's nature, for example, is constituted by his memories and\nthe rest of his knowledge, by his loves and hatreds, and so on; thus,\nbut for the objects which he knows or loves or hates, he could not be\nwhat he is. He is essentially and obviously a fragment: taken as the\n",

But if the word\n'nature' is used in this sense, we shall have to hold that the thing\nmay be known when its 'nature' is not known, or at any rate is not known\ncompletely. There is a confusion, when this use of the word 'nature' is\n",
        "456": "employed, between knowledge of things and knowledge of truths. We may\nhave knowledge of a thing by acquaintance even if we know very few\npropositions about it--theoretically we need not know any propositions\nabout it.

        "457": "is involved in our knowing any one proposition about a thing, knowledge\nof its 'nature', in the above sense, is not involved. Hence, (1)\nacquaintance with a thing does not logically involve a knowledge of its\nrelations, and (2) a knowledge of some of its relations does not involve\na knowledge of all of its relations nor a knowledge of its 'nature' in\nthe above sense. I may be acquainted, for example, with my toothache,\nand this knowledge may be as complete as knowledge by acquaintance ever\ncan be, without knowing all that the dentist (who is not acquainted\nwith it) can tell me about its cause, and without therefore knowing its\n'nature' in the above sense. Thus the fact that a thing has relations\n",

        "459": "It follows that we cannot prove that the universe as a whole forms a\nsingle harmonious system such as Hegel believes that it forms. And if we\ncannot prove this, we also cannot prove the unreality of space and time\nand matter and evil, for this is deduced by Hegel from the fragmentary\nand relational character of these things.

The\nwhole tendency of modern thought, however, is more and more in the\ndirection of showing that the supposed contradictions were illusory, and\nthat very little can be proved _a priori_ from considerations of what\n_must_ be. A good illustration of this is afforded by space and\n",

Thus a contradiction emerged between the apparent nature of\nspace and time and the supposed impossibility of infinite collections.\n",

The attempt to prescribe to the\nuniverse by means of _a priori_ principles has broken down; logic,\ninstead of being, as formerly, the bar to possibilities, has become the\ngreat liberator of the imagination, presenting innumerable alternatives\nwhich are closed to unreflective common sense, and leaving to experience\nthe task of deciding, where decision is possible, between the many\nworlds which logic offers for our choice.

But as regards\nwhat would be commonly accepted as knowledge, our result is in the main\npositive: we have seldom found reason to reject such knowledge as the\nresult of our criticism, and we have seen no reason to suppose man\nincapable of the kind of knowledge which he is generally believed to\npossess.\n",

THE VALUE OF PHILOSOPHY\nHaving now come to the end of our brief and very incomplete review of\nthe problems of philosophy, it will be well to consider, in conclusion,\nwhat is the value of philosophy and why it ought to be studied. It is\nthe more necessary to consider this question, in view of the fact that\nmany men, under the influence of science or of practical affairs, are\ninclined to doubt whether philosophy is anything better than innocent\nbut useless trifling, hair-splitting distinctions, and controversies on\nmatters concerning which knowledge is impossible.\n",
        "480": "This view of philosophy appears to result, partly from a wrong\nconception of the ends of life, partly from a wrong conception of the\nkind of goods which philosophy strives to achieve. Physical science,\nthrough the medium of inventions, is useful to innumerable people who\nare wholly ignorant of it; thus the study of physical science is to\nbe recommended, not only, or primarily, because of the effect on the\nstudent, but rather because of the effect on mankind in general. Thus\nutility does not belong to philosophy. If the study of philosophy has\n",
        "481": "any value at all for others than students of philosophy, it must be only\nindirectly, through its effects upon the lives of those who study it.\nIt is in these effects, therefore, if anywhere, that the value of\nphilosophy must be primarily sought.\nBut further, if we are not to fail in our endeavour to determine the\nvalue of philosophy, we must first free our minds from the prejudices\nof what are wrongly called 'practical' men. The 'practical' man, as\n",
        "482": "this word is often used, is one who recognizes only material needs, who\nrealizes that men must have food for the body, but is oblivious of the\nnecessity of providing food for the mind. If all men were well off, if\npoverty and disease had been reduced to their lowest possible point,\nthere would still remain much to be done to produce a valuable society;\nand even in the existing world the goods of the mind are at least as\nimportant as the goods of the body. It is exclusively among the goods of\nthe mind that the value of philosophy is to be found; and only those who\nare not indifferent to these goods can be persuaded that the study of\nphilosophy is not a waste of time.\n",
        "483": "Philosophy, like all other studies, aims primarily at knowledge. The\nknowledge it aims at is the kind of knowledge which gives unity and\nsystem to the body of the sciences, and the kind which results from a\ncritical examination of the grounds of our convictions, prejudices, and\nbeliefs. But it cannot be maintained that philosophy has had any very\ngreat measure of success in its attempts to provide definite answers to\nits questions. If you ask a mathematician, a mineralogist, a historian,\n",
        "484": "or any other man of learning, what definite body of truths has been\nascertained by his science, his answer will last as long as you are\nwilling to listen. But if you put the same question to a philosopher, he\nwill, if he is candid, have to confess that his study has not achieved\npositive results such as have been achieved by other sciences. It is\ntrue that this is partly accounted for by the fact that, as soon as\ndefinite knowledge concerning any subject becomes possible, this subject\nceases to be called philosophy, and becomes a separate science. The\n",

Similarly, the study of the human\nmind, which was a part of philosophy, has now been separated from\nphilosophy and has become the science of psychology. Thus, to a great\nextent, the uncertainty of philosophy is more apparent than real: those\nquestions which are already capable of definite answers are placed in\nthe sciences, while those only to which, at present, no definite answer\ncan be given, remain to form the residue which is called philosophy.\n",
        "486": "This is, however, only a part of the truth concerning the uncertainty of\nphilosophy. There are many questions--and among them those that are of\nthe profoundest interest to our spiritual life--which, so far as we\ncan see, must remain insoluble to the human intellect unless its powers\nbecome of quite a different order from what they are now. Has the\nuniverse any unity of plan or purpose, or is it a fortuitous concourse\nof atoms? Is consciousness a permanent part of the universe, giving\n",
        "487": "hope of indefinite growth in wisdom, or is it a transitory accident on\na small planet on which life must ultimately become impossible?

Yet, however slight may be the hope of discovering an answer, it\nis part of the business of philosophy to continue the consideration of\nsuch questions, to make us aware of their importance, to examine all the\napproaches to them, and to keep alive that speculative interest in the\nuniverse which is apt to be killed by confining ourselves to definitely\nascertainable knowledge.\nMany philosophers, it is true, have held that philosophy could establish\nthe truth of certain answers to such fundamental questions. They have\n",

In order to judge of such\nattempts, it is necessary to take a survey of human knowledge, and to\nform an opinion as to its methods and its limitations.

Thus, while diminishing our\nfeeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our\nknowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant\ndogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of\nliberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing\nfamiliar things in an unfamiliar aspect.\nApart from its utility in showing unsuspected possibilities, philosophy\nhas a value--perhaps its chief value--through the greatness of the\nobjects which it contemplates, and the freedom from narrow and personal\naims resulting from this contemplation.

In such a life there is something feverish and confined, in\ncomparison with which the philosophic life is calm and free. The private\nworld of instinctive interests is a small one, set in the midst of a\ngreat and powerful world which must, sooner or later, lay our private\nworld in ruins. Unless we can so enlarge our interests as to include the\n",
        "494": "whole outer world, we remain like a garrison in a beleagured fortress,\nknowing that the enemy prevents escape and that ultimate surrender is\ninevitable. In such a life there is no peace, but a constant strife\nbetween the insistence of desire and the powerlessness of will. In one\nway or another, if our life is to be great and free, we must escape this\nprison and this strife.\n",
        "495": "One way of escape is by philosophic contemplation. Philosophic\ncontemplation does not, in its widest survey, divide the universe into\ntwo hostile camps--friends and foes, helpful and hostile, good and\nbad--it views the whole impartially. Philosophic contemplation, when it\nis unalloyed, does not aim at proving that the rest of the universe is\nakin to man. All acquisition of knowledge is an enlargement of the Self,\n",
        "496": "but this enlargement is best attained when it is not directly sought. It\nis obtained when the desire for knowledge is alone operative, by a study\nwhich does not wish in advance that its objects should have this or that\ncharacter, but adapts the Self to the characters which it finds in its\nobjects. This enlargement of Self is not obtained when, taking the Self\nas it is, we try to show that the world is so similar to this Self that\nknowledge of it is possible without any admission of what seems alien.\n",
        "497": "The desire to prove this is a form of self-assertion and, like all\nself-assertion, it is an obstacle to the growth of Self which it\ndesires, and of which the Self knows that it is capable. Self-assertion,\nin philosophic speculation as elsewhere, views the world as a means to\nits own ends; thus it makes the world of less account than Self, and the\nSelf sets bounds to the greatness of its goods. In contemplation, on\nthe contrary, we start from the not-Self, and through its greatness the\nboundaries of Self are enlarged; through the infinity of the universe\nthe mind which contemplates it achieves some share in infinity.\n",
        "498": "For this reason greatness of soul is not fostered by those philosophies\nwhich assimilate the universe to Man. Knowledge is a form of union\nof Self and not-Self; like all union, it is impaired by dominion, and\ntherefore by any attempt to force the universe into conformity with\nwhat we find in ourselves. There is a widespread philosophical tendency\ntowards the view which tells us that Man is the measure of all things,\nthat truth is man-made, that space and time and the world of universals\nare properties of the mind, and that, if there be anything not created\nby the mind, it is unknowable and of no account for us. This view, if\n",
        "499": "our previous discussions were correct, is untrue; but in addition to\nbeing untrue, it has the effect of robbing philosophic contemplation of\nall that gives it value, since it fetters contemplation to Self. What\nit calls knowledge is not a union with the not-Self, but a set of\nprejudices, habits, and desires, making an impenetrable veil between\nus and the world beyond. The man who finds pleasure in such a theory of\nknowledge is like the man who never leaves the domestic circle for fear\nhis word might not be law.\n",
        "500": "The true philosophic contemplation, on the contrary, finds its\nsatisfaction in every enlargement of the not-Self, in everything\nthat magnifies the objects contemplated, and thereby the subject\ncontemplating. Everything, in contemplation, that is personal or\nprivate, everything that depends upon habit, self-interest, or desire,\ndistorts the object, and hence impairs the union which the intellect\nseeks. By thus making a barrier between subject and object, such\npersonal and private things become a prison to the intellect. The free\n",
        "501": "intellect will see as God might see, without a _here_ and _now_,\nwithout hopes and fears, without the trammels of customary beliefs\nand traditional prejudices, calmly, dispassionately, in the sole and\nexclusive desire of knowledge--knowledge as impersonal, as purely\ncontemplative, as it is possible for man to attain. Hence also the free\nintellect will value more the abstract and universal knowledge into\nwhich the accidents of private history do not enter, than the knowledge\nbrought by the senses, and dependent, as such knowledge must be, upon\nan exclusive and personal point of view and a body whose sense-organs\ndistort as much as they reveal.\nThe mind which has become accustomed to the freedom and impartiality of\nphilosophic contemplation will preserve something of the same freedom\nand impartiality in the world of action and emotion. It will view\n",
        "502": "its purposes and desires as parts of the whole, with the absence of\ninsistence that results from seeing them as infinitesimal fragments in\na world of which all the rest is unaffected by any one man's deeds. The\nimpartiality which, in contemplation, is the unalloyed desire for truth,\nis the very same quality of mind which, in action, is justice, and in\nemotion is that universal love which can be given to all, and not only\nto those who are judged useful or admirable. Thus contemplation enlarges\nnot only the objects of our thoughts, but also the objects of our\nactions and our affections: it makes us citizens of the universe, not\nonly of one walled city at war with all the rest. In this citizenship\n",
        "503": "of the universe consists man's true freedom, and his liberation from the\nthraldom of narrow hopes and fears.\nThus, to sum up our discussion of the value of philosophy; Philosophy\nis to be studied, not for the sake of any definite answers to its\nquestions, since no definite answers can, as a rule, be known to be\ntrue, but rather for the sake of the questions themselves; because\nthese questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich\nour intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic assurance which\ncloses the mind against speculation; but above all because, through the\ngreatness of the universe which philosophy contemplates, the mind also\nis rendered great, and becomes capable of that union with the universe\nwhich constitutes its highest good.\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\nThe student who wishes to acquire an elementary knowledge of philosophy\nwill find it both easier and more profitable to read some of the works\nof the great philosophers than to attempt to derive an all-round view\nfrom handbooks.
