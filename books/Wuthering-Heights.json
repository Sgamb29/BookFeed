        "1": "Wuthering Heights\nby Emily Bront\u00eb\nCHAPTER I\n1801\u2014I have just returned from a visit to my landlord\u2014the solitary\nneighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful\ncountry! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a\nsituation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect\n",
        "2": "misanthropist\u2019s Heaven\u2014and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable\npair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little\nimagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes\nwithdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his\nfingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further\nin his waistcoat, as I announced my name.\n",
        "3": "\u201cMr. Heathcliff?\u201d I said.\nA nod was the answer.\n\u201cMr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir. I do myself the honour of calling\n",
        "4": "as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have\nnot inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation\nof Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThrushcross Grange is my own, sir,\u201d he interrupted, wincing. \u201cI should\nnot allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it\u2014walk in!\u201d\nThe \u201cwalk in\u201d was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the\nsentiment, \u201cGo to the Deuce!\u201d even the gate over which he leant\n",
        "5": "manifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that\ncircumstance determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested\nin a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.\nWhen he saw my horse\u2019s breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put\nout his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the\ncauseway, calling, as we entered the court,\u2014\u201cJoseph, take Mr.\nLockwood\u2019s horse; and bring up some wine.\u201d\n",
        "6": "\u201cHere we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,\u201d was the\nreflection suggested by this compound order. \u201cNo wonder the grass grows\nup between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.\u201d\nJoseph was an elderly, nay, an old man, very old, perhaps, though hale\nand sinewy. \u201cThe Lord help us!\u201d he soliloquised in an undertone of\n",
        "7": "peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime,\nin my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of\ndivine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no\nreference to my unexpected advent.\nWuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff\u2019s dwelling. \u201cWuthering\u201d\nbeing a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the\natmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.\n",
        "8": "Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed:\none may guess the power of the north wind, blowing over the edge, by\nthe excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and\nby a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if\ncraving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build\nit strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the\ncorners defended with large jutting stones.\nBefore passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of\ngrotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the\nprincipal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins\nand shameless little boys, I detected the date \u201c1500,\u201d and the name\n\u201cHareton Earnshaw.\u201d I would have made a few comments, and requested a\n",
        "9": "short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at\nthe door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure,\nand I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting\nthe penetralium.\nOne step brought us into the family sitting-room, without any\nintroductory lobby or passage: they call it here \u201cthe house\u201d\npre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I\nbelieve at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat\naltogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of\ntongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I\nobserved no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge\nfireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on\nthe walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat\n",
        "10": "from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and\ntankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very\nroof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay\nbare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with\noatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it.\nAbove the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of\nhorse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily painted canisters\ndisposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the\n",
        "11": "chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two\nheavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser\nreposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of\nsquealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.\nThe apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as\nbelonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance,\nand stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters.\n",
        "12": "Such an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on\nthe round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six\nmiles among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner. But\nMr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of\nliving. He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a\n",
        "13": "gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire:\nrather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence,\nbecause he has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.\nPossibly, some people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred\npride; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of\nthe sort: I know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to\nshowy displays of feeling\u2014to manifestations of mutual kindliness. He\u2019ll\nlove and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of\nimpertinence to be loved or hated again. No, I\u2019m running on too fast: I\n",
        "14": "bestow my own attributes over-liberally on him. Mr. Heathcliff may have\nentirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he\nmeets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me. Let me hope\nmy constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should\nnever have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself\nperfectly unworthy of one.\n",
        "15": "While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown\ninto the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my\neyes, as long as she took no notice of me. I \u201cnever told my love\u201d\nvocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have\nguessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked\na return\u2014the sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I\nconfess it with shame\u2014shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every\nglance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was\nled to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her\nsupposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.\n",
        "16": "By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of\ndeliberate heartlessness; how undeserved, I alone can appreciate.\nI took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which\nmy landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by\nattempting to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and\nwas sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and\nher white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long,\nguttural gnarl.\n",
        "17": "\u201cYou\u2019d better let the dog alone,\u201d growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison,\nchecking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. \u201cShe\u2019s not\naccustomed to be spoiled\u2014not kept for a pet.\u201d Then, striding to a side\n",
        "18": "door, he shouted again, \u201cJoseph!\u201d\nJoseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no\nintimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me\n_vis-\u00e0-vis_ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs,\nwho shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not\nanxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but,\nimagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately\nindulged in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my\nphysiognomy so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and\nleapt on my knees. I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the\n",
        "19": "table between us. This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen\nfour-footed fiends, of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens\nto the common centre. I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects\nof assault; and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I\ncould with the poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance\nfrom some of the household in re-establishing peace.\n",
        "20": "Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious\nphlegm: I don\u2019t think they moved one second faster than usual, though\nthe hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily, an\ninhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch; a lusty dame, with\ntucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the\nmidst of us flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her\ntongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she\nonly remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master\nentered on the scene.\n",
        "21": "\u201cWhat the devil is the matter?\u201d he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I\ncould ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.\n\u201cWhat the devil, indeed!\u201d I muttered. \u201cThe herd of possessed swine\n",
        "22": "could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours,\nsir. You might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!\u201d\n\u201cThey won\u2019t meddle with persons who touch nothing,\u201d he remarked,\nputting the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table. \u201cThe\ndogs do right to be vigilant. Take a glass of wine?\u201d\n",
        "23": "\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cNot bitten, are you?\u201d\n\u201cIf I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.\u201d Heathcliff\u2019s\n",
        "24": "countenance relaxed into a grin.\n\u201cCome, come,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are flurried, Mr. Lockwood. Here, take a\nlittle wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my\n",
        "25": "dogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them. Your\nhealth, sir?\u201d\nI bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be\nfoolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides,\nI felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since\nhis humour took that turn. He\u2014probably swayed by prudential\n",
        "26": "consideration of the folly of offending a good tenant\u2014relaxed a little\nin the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs,\nand introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me,\u2014a\ndiscourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of\nretirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and\nbefore I went home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another\nvisit to-morrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I\nshall go, notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself\n",
        "27": "compared with him.\nCHAPTER II\nYesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend\nit by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to\nWuthering Heights. On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.\u2014I dine\n",

Being unable to remove the\n",
        "29": "chain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered\nwith straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till\nmy knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.\n\u201cWretched inmates!\u201d I ejaculated, mentally, \u201cyou deserve perpetual\nisolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least,\n",
        "30": "I would not keep my doors barred in the day-time. I don\u2019t care\u2014I will\nget in!\u201d So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.\nVinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the\nbarn.\n",
        "31": "\u201cWhat are ye for?\u201d he shouted. \u201cT\u2019 maister\u2019s down i\u2019 t\u2019 fowld. Go round\nby th\u2019 end o\u2019 t\u2019 laith, if ye went to spake to him.\u201d\n\u201cIs there nobody inside to open the door?\u201d I hallooed, responsively.\n",
        "32": "\u201cThere\u2019s nobbut t\u2019 missis; and shoo\u2019ll not oppen \u2019t an ye mak\u2019 yer\nflaysome dins till neeght.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?\u201d\n\u201cNor-ne me! I\u2019ll hae no hend wi\u2019t,\u201d muttered the head, vanishing.\n",
        "33": "The snow began to drive thickly. I seized the handle to essay another\ntrial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork,\nappeared in the yard behind. He hailed me to follow him, and, after\nmarching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed,\npump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful\napartment where I was formerly received.

I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me\ntake a seat. She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained\nmotionless and mute.\n",
        "35": "\u201cRough weather!\u201d I remarked. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door\nmust bear the consequence of your servants\u2019 leisure attendance: I had\nhard work to make them hear me.\u201d\nShe never opened her mouth. I stared\u2014she stared also: at any rate, she\n",
        "36": "kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly\nembarrassing and disagreeable.\n\u201cSit down,\u201d said the young man, gruffly. \u201cHe\u2019ll be in soon.\u201d\nI obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this\nsecond interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of\nowning my acquaintance.\n",
        "37": "\u201cA beautiful animal!\u201d I commenced again. \u201cDo you intend parting with\nthe little ones, madam?\u201d\n\u201cThey are not mine,\u201d said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than\nHeathcliff himself could have replied.\n",
        "38": "\u201cAh, your favourites are among these?\u201d I continued, turning to an\nobscure cushion full of something like cats.\n\u201cA strange choice of favourites!\u201d she observed scornfully.\n",
        "39": "Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits. I hemmed once more, and drew\ncloser to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the\nevening.\n\u201cYou should not have come out,\u201d she said, rising and reaching from the\nchimney-piece two of the painted canisters.\n",
        "40": "Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct\nview of her whole figure and countenance. She was slender, and\napparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most\nexquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding;\nsmall features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging\nloose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in\nexpression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my\nsusceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between\nscorn and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected\nthere. The canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to\naid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted\nto assist him in counting his gold.\n",
        "41": "\u201cI don\u2019t want your help,\u201d she snapped; \u201cI can get them for myself.\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon!\u201d I hastened to reply.\n\u201cWere you asked to tea?\u201d she demanded, tying an apron over her neat\n",
        "42": "black frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the\npot.\n\u201cI shall be glad to have a cup,\u201d I answered.\n\u201cWere you asked?\u201d she repeated.\n",
        "43": "\u201cNo,\u201d I said, half smiling. \u201cYou are the proper person to ask me.\u201d\nShe flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet;\nher forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a\nchild\u2019s ready to cry.\nMeanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby\nupper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on\nme from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some\nmortal feud unavenged between us. I began to doubt whether he were a\n",
        "44": "servant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of\nthe superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown\ncurls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly\nover his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common\nlabourer: still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed\nnone of a domestic\u2019s assiduity in attending on the lady of the house.\nIn the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to\nabstain from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes\nafterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure,\nfrom my uncomfortable state.\n",
        "45": "\u201cYou see, sir, I am come, according to promise!\u201d I exclaimed, assuming\nthe cheerful; \u201cand I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if\nyou can afford me shelter during that space.\u201d\n\u201cHalf an hour?\u201d he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; \u201cI\n",
        "46": "wonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in.\nDo you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes? People\nfamiliar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I\ncan tell you there is no chance of a change at present.\u201d\n",
        "47": "\u201cPerhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the\nGrange till morning\u2014could you spare me one?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I could not.\u201d\n\u201cOh, indeed! Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.\u201d\n",
        "48": "\u201cUmph!\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to mak\u2019 the tea?\u201d demanded he of the shabby coat,\nshifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.\n",
        "49": "\u201cIs _he_ to have any?\u201d she asked, appealing to Heathcliff.\n\u201cGet it ready, will you?\u201d was the answer, uttered so savagely that I\nstarted. The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad\n",

        "51": "I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort\nto dispel it.

        "53": "\u201cWell, yes\u2014oh, you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of\nministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even\nwhen her body is gone. Is that it?\u201d\nPerceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it. I might have\nseen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to\nmake it likely that they were man and wife. One was about forty: a\n",

        "55": "I cause her to regret her choice.\u201d The last reflection may seem\nconceited; it was not. My neighbour struck me as bordering on\nrepulsive; I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive.\n",
        "56": "\u201cMrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,\u201d said Heathcliff, corroborating\nmy surmise. He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a\nlook of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles\nthat will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of\nhis soul.\n",
        "57": "\u201cAh, certainly\u2014I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the\nbeneficent fairy,\u201d I remarked, turning to my neighbour.\nThis was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his\nfist, with every appearance of a meditated assault. But he seemed to\nrecollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse,\nmuttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice.\n",
        "58": "\u201cUnhappy in your conjectures, sir,\u201d observed my host; \u201cwe neither of us\nhave the privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead.

        "59": "Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to\nattribute the paternity of that bear to him.\n\u201cMy name is Hareton Earnshaw,\u201d growled the other; \u201cand I\u2019d counsel you\nto respect it!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve shown no disrespect,\u201d was my reply, laughing internally at the\ndignity with which he announced himself.\n",
        "60": "He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for\nfear I might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity\naudible. I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant\nfamily circle. The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than\nneutralised, the glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to\nbe cautious how I ventured under those rafters a third time.\n",
        "61": "The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of\nsociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather. A\nsorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and\nhills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,\u201d I\ncould not help exclaiming. \u201cThe roads will be buried already; and, if\n",

He took to\nHeathcliff strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said\nprecious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above\nCathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.\n",

Catherine caught and perused it eagerly;\n",

She showed a good heart, thenceforth, in\navoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning\nHeathcliff; and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to\nraise a bad spirit between him and Hareton: indeed, I don\u2019t believe she\nhas ever breathed a syllable, in the latter\u2019s hearing, against her\noppressor since.\n",
