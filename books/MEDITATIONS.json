After all had been done possible to allay famine and to supply\npressing needs--Marcus being forced even to sell the imperial jewels to\nfind money--both emperors set forth to a struggle which was to continue\nmore or less during the rest of Marcus's reign.

But before he could come to the east news had\ncome to Cassius that the emperor still lived; his followers fell away\nfrom him, and he was assassinated. Marcus now went to the east, and\nwhile there the murderers brought the head of Cassius to him; but the\nemperor indignantly refused their gift, nor would he admit the men to\nhis presence.\n",

The Roman religion was in fact\nof the nature of a bargain: men paid certain sacrifices and rites, and\nthe gods granted their favour, irrespective of right or wrong.

Cyprus has been from time immemorial a meeting-place of the East\nand West, and although we cannot grant any importance to a possible\nstrain of Phoenician blood in him (for the Ph\u0153nicians were no\nphilosophers), yet it is quite likely that through Asia Minor he may\nhave come in touch with the Far East.

In order to live in accord with nature, it is necessary\nto know what nature is; and to this end a threefold division of\nphilosophy is made\u2014into _Physics_, dealing with the universe and its\nlaws, the problems of divine government and teleology; _Logic_, which\ntrains the mind to discern true from false; and _Ethics_, which applies\nthe knowledge thus gained and tested to practical life.\n",
        "31": "The Stoic system of physics was materialism with an infusion of\npantheism. In contradiction to Plato's view that the Ideas, or\nPrototypes, of phenomena alone really exist, the Stoics held that\nmaterial objects alone existed; but immanent in the material universe\nwas a spiritual force which acted through them, manifesting itself\nunder many forms, as fire, \u00e6ther, spirit, soul, reason, the ruling\nprinciple.\nThe universe, then, is God, of whom the popular gods are manifestations;\nwhile legends and myths are allegorical.

        "35": "spoken. The highest good was the virtuous life. Virtue alone is\nhappiness, and vice is unhappiness. Carrying this theory to its\nextreme, the Stoic said that there could be no gradations between\nvirtue and vice, though of course each has its special manifestations.\n",
        "36": "Moreover, nothing is good but virtue, and nothing but vice is bad.\nThose outside things which are commonly called good or bad, such as\nhealth and sickness, wealth and poverty, pleasure and pain, are to him\nindifferent (\u1f00\u03b4\u03b9\u1f71\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1).

It is probable that no Stoic claimed for\nhimself that he was this Wise Man, but that each strove after it as an\nideal much as the Christian strives after a likeness to Christ. The\nexaggeration in this statement was, however, so obvious, that the later\nStoics were driven to make a further subdivision of things indifferent\ninto what is preferable (\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b7\u03b3\u03bc\u1f73\u03bd\u03b1) and what is undesirable\n(\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b7\u03b3\u03bc\u1f73\u03bd\u03b1).

        "39": "careful distinction between things which are in our power and things\nwhich are not. Desire and dislike, opinion and affection, are within\nthe power of the will; whereas health, wealth, honour, and other such\nare generally not so. The Stoic was called upon to control his desires\nand affections, and to guide his opinion; to bring his whole being\nunder the sway of the will or leading principle, just as the universe\nis guided and governed by divine Providence.

The second point is a\nstrong insistence on the unity of the universe, and on man's duty as\npart of a great whole. Public spirit was the most splendid political\nvirtue of the ancient world, and it is here made cosmopolitan. It is\n",
        "41": "again instructive to note that Christian sages insisted on the same\nthing. Christians are taught that they are members of a worldwide\nbrotherhood, where is neither Greek nor Hebrew, bond nor free and that\nthey live their lives as fellow-workers with God.\nSuch is the system which underlies the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius.\n",
        "42": "Some knowledge of it is necessary to the right understanding of the\nbook, but for us the chief interest lies elsewhere. We do not come to\nMarcus Aurelius for a treatise on Stoicism.

        "43": "intellectual inquiry, but more what we should call religious feeling.\nThe uncompromising stiffness of Zeno or Chrysippus is softened and\ntransformed by passing through a nature reverent and tolerant, gentle\nand free from guile; the grim resignation which made life possible to\nthe Stoic sage becomes in him almost a mood of aspiration. His book\nrecords the innermost thoughts of his heart, set down to ease it, with\nsuch moral maxims and reflections as may help him to bear the burden of\nduty and the countless annoyances of a busy life.\n",
        "44": "It is instructive to compare the _Meditations_ with another famous book,\nthe _Imitation of Christ_. There is the same ideal of self-control in\nboth.

Theophrastus, where he compares sin with sin (as after a vulgar\nsense such things I grant may be compared:) says well and like a\nphilosopher, that those sins are greater which are committed through\nlust, than those which are committed through anger.

But if it be so that there be no\ngods, or that they take no care of the world, why should I desire to\nlive in a world void of gods, and of all divine providence? But gods\nthere be certainly, and they take care for the world; and as for those\nthings which be truly evil, as vice and wickedness, such things they\nhave put in a man's own power, that he might avoid them if he would: and\nhad there been anything besides that had been truly bad and evil, they\nwould have had a care of that also, that a man might have avoided it.\n",

It cannot be that she through want either of power or\nskill, should have committed such a thing, so as to suffer all things\nboth good and bad, equally and promiscuously, to happen unto all both\ngood and bad. As for life therefore, and death, honour and dishonour,\n",

It is the part of a man endowed with a good understanding faculty, to\nconsider what they themselves are in very deed, from whose bare conceits\nand voices, honour and credit do proceed: as also what it is to die, and\nhow if a man shall consider this by itself alone, to die, and separate\nfrom it in his mind all those things which with it usually represent\nthemselves unto us, he can conceive of it no otherwise, than as of a\nwork of nature, and he that fears any work of nature, is a very child.\n",
