The shape of the letters on\nmy father\u2019s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,\nwith curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,\n\u201c_Also Georgiana Wife of the Above_,\u201d I drew a childish conclusion that\nmy mother was freckled and sickly.

There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.\nWhen the church came to itself,\u2014for he was so sudden and strong that he\nmade it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my\nfeet,\u2014when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high\ntombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.\n[Illustration]\n\u201cYou young dog,\u201d said the man, licking his lips, \u201cwhat fat cheeks you\nha\u2019 got.\u201d\n",

        "18": "After darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer to\nmy tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he\ncould hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,\nand mine looked most helplessly up into his.\n\u201cNow lookee here,\u201d he said, \u201cthe question being whether you\u2019re to be\nlet to live. You know what a file is?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n",
        "19": "\u201cAnd you know what wittles is?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\nAfter each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a\ngreater sense of helplessness and danger.\n",
        "20": "\u201cYou get me a file.\u201d He tilted me again. \u201cAnd you get me wittles.\u201d He\ntilted me again. \u201cYou bring \u2019em both to me.\u201d He tilted me again. \u201cOr\nI\u2019ll have your heart and liver out.\u201d He tilted me again.\n",
        "21": "I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both\nhands, and said, \u201cIf you would kindly please to let me keep upright,\nsir, perhaps I shouldn\u2019t be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.\u201d\nHe gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped\nover its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright\nposition on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:\u2014\n\u201cYou bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You\n",
        "22": "bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and\nyou never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your\nhaving seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall\nbe let to live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no\nmatter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore\nout, roasted, and ate. Now, I ain\u2019t alone, as you may think I am.\n",
        "23": "There\u2019s a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man I\nam a Angel. That young man hears the words I speak. That young man has\na secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his\nheart, and at his liver. It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide\nhimself from that young man. A boy may lock his door, may be warm in\n",

I am a keeping that young man\nfrom harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty. I\nfind it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside. Now, what\n",
        "25": "do you say?\u201d\nI said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken\nbits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in\nthe morning.\n\u201cSay Lord strike you dead if you don\u2019t!\u201d said the man.\n",
        "26": "I said so, and he took me down.\n\u201cNow,\u201d he pursued, \u201cyou remember what you\u2019ve undertook, and you\nremember that young man, and you get home!\u201d\n\u201cGoo-good night, sir,\u201d I faltered.\n",
        "27": "\u201cMuch of that!\u201d said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. \u201cI\nwish I was a frog. Or a eel!\u201d\nAt the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his\narms,\u2014clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,\u2014and limped\ntowards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the\n",
        "28": "nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked\nin my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,\nstretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his\nankle and pull him in.\nWhen he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose\nlegs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When\nI saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of\nmy legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on\n",
        "29": "again towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and\npicking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into\nthe marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were\nheavy or the tide was in.\nThe marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped\nto look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not\nnearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long\nangry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the\nriver I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the\nprospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the\nbeacon by which the sailors steered,\u2014like an unhooped cask upon a\npole,\u2014an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with\nsome chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was\n",
        "30": "limping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life,\nand come down, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a\nterrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their\nheads to gaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. I\nlooked all round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of\nhim. But now I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.\n",
        "31": "Chapter II.\nMy sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,\nand had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours\nbecause she had brought me up \u201cby hand.\u201d Having at that time to find\n",
        "32": "out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a\nhard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her\nhusband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both\nbrought up by hand.\nShe was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general\nimpression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand. Joe\nwas a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth\nface, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to\nhave somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild,\n",
        "33": "good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,\u2014a sort\nof Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.\nMy sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing\nredness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible\nshe washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall\n",
        "34": "and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her\nfigure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in\nfront, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful\nmerit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this\napron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn\nit at all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken\nit off, every day of her life.\n",
        "35": "Joe\u2019s forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of\nthe dwellings in our country were,\u2014most of them, at that time. When I\nran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was\nsitting alone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and\nhaving confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment\nI raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,\nsitting in the chimney corner.\n",
        "36": "\u201cMrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And she\u2019s\nout now, making it a baker\u2019s dozen.\u201d\n\u201cIs she?\u201d\n",
        "37": "\u201cYes, Pip,\u201d said Joe; \u201cand what\u2019s worse, she\u2019s got Tickler with her.\u201d\nAt this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat\nround and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler\nwas a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled\nframe.\n",
        "38": "\u201cShe sot down,\u201d said Joe, \u201cand she got up, and she made a grab at\nTickler, and she Ram-paged out. That\u2019s what she did,\u201d said Joe, slowly\nclearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at\nit; \u201cshe Ram-paged out, Pip.\u201d\n\u201cHas she been gone long, Joe?\u201d I always treated him as a larger species\n",
        "39": "of child, and as no more than my equal.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, \u201cshe\u2019s been on the\nRam-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She\u2019s a-coming! Get\nbehind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.\u201d\n",
        "40": "I took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,\nand finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause,\nand applied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by\nthrowing me\u2014I often served as a connubial missile\u2014at Joe, who, glad to\nget hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly\nfenced me up there with his great leg.\n",
        "41": "\u201cWhere have you been, you young monkey?\u201d said Mrs. Joe, stamping her\nfoot. \u201cTell me directly what you\u2019ve been doing to wear me away with\nfret and fright and worrit, or I\u2019d have you out of that corner if you\nwas fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys.\u201d\n",
        "42": "\u201cI have only been to the churchyard,\u201d said I, from my stool, crying and\nrubbing myself.\n\u201cChurchyard!\u201d repeated my sister. \u201cIf it warn\u2019t for me you\u2019d have been\nto the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by\n",
        "43": "hand?\u201d\n\u201cYou did,\u201d said I.\n\u201cAnd why did I do it, I should like to know?\u201d exclaimed my sister.\n",
        "44": "I whimpered, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201c_I_ don\u2019t!\u201d said my sister. \u201cI\u2019d never do it again! I know that. I may\ntruly say I\u2019ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were.\n",
        "45": "It\u2019s bad enough to be a blacksmith\u2019s wife (and him a Gargery) without\nbeing your mother.\u201d\nMy thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at\nthe fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the\nmysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was\nunder to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me\nin the avenging coals.\n",
        "46": "\u201cHah!\u201d said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station. \u201cChurchyard,\nindeed! You may well say churchyard, you two.\u201d One of us, by the by,\nhad not said it at all. \u201cYou\u2019ll drive _me_ to the churchyard betwixt\n",
        "47": "you, one of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you\u2019d be without\nme!\u201d\nAs she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me\nover his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and\ncalculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the\ngrievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling his\nright-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with\n",
        "48": "his blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.\nMy sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,\nthat never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard\nand fast against her bib,\u2014where it sometimes got a pin into it, and\nsometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she\n",
        "49": "took some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf,\nin an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,\u2014using\nboth sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and\nmoulding the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a\nfinal smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very\nthick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the\nloaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.\nOn the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice.\n",
        "50": "I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful\nacquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew\nMrs. Joe\u2019s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my\nlarcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.\n",
        "51": "Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of\nmy trousers.\nThe effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I\nfound to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap\nfrom the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.\n",
        "52": "And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In our\nalready-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his\ngood-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare\nthe way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each\nother\u2019s admiration now and then,\u2014which stimulated us to new exertions.\nTo-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast\ndiminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he\nfound me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my\nuntouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately\n",
        "53": "considered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it had\nbest be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the\ncircumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at\nme, and got my bread and butter down my leg.\nJoe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss\nof appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he\ndidn\u2019t seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than\n",
        "54": "usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like\na pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on\none side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw\nthat my bread and butter was gone.\nThe wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of\nhis bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister\u2019s\nobservation.\n",
        "55": "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter _now_?\u201d said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.\n\u201cI say, you know!\u201d muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious\nremonstrance. \u201cPip, old chap! You\u2019ll do yourself a mischief. It\u2019ll\n",
        "56": "stick somewhere. You can\u2019t have chawed it, Pip.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter now?\u201d repeated my sister, more sharply than before.\n\u201cIf you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I\u2019d recommend you to do\nit,\u201d said Joe, all aghast. \u201cManners is manners, but still your elth\u2019s\n",
        "57": "your elth.\u201d\nBy this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,\nand, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little\nwhile against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking\nguiltily on.\n\u201cNow, perhaps you\u2019ll mention what\u2019s the matter,\u201d said my sister, out of\nbreath, \u201cyou staring great stuck pig.\u201d\n",
        "58": "Joe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and\nlooked at me again.\n\u201cYou know, Pip,\u201d said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,\nand speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,\n\u201cyou and me is always friends, and I\u2019d be the last to tell upon you,\nany time. But such a\u2014\u201d he moved his chair and looked about the floor\nbetween us, and then again at me\u2014\u201csuch a most oncommon Bolt as that!\u201d\n",
        "59": "\u201cBeen bolting his food, has he?\u201d cried my sister.\n\u201cYou know, old chap,\u201d said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,\nwith his bite still in his cheek, \u201cI Bolted, myself, when I was your\nage\u2014frequent\u2014and as a boy I\u2019ve been among a many Bolters; but I never\nsee your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it\u2019s a mercy you ain\u2019t Bolted\ndead.\u201d\n",
        "60": "My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying\nnothing more than the awful words, \u201cYou come along and be dosed.\u201d\nSome medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine\nmedicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;\nhaving a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the\n",
        "61": "best of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a\nchoice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like\na new fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded\na pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater\ncomfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would be\nheld in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to\n",

        "512": "\u201cHow do _you_ come here?\u201d\n\u201cMiss Havisham sent for me, sir,\u201d I explained.\n\u201cWell! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, and\n",

I wondered whether\n",
        "514": "he could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn\u2019t be a doctor, or he\nwould have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much\ntime to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham\u2019s room,\nwhere she and everything else were just as I had left them. Estella\nleft me standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham\ncast her eyes upon me from the dressing-table.\n",
        "515": "\u201cSo!\u201d she said, without being startled or surprised: \u201cthe days have\nworn away, have they?\u201d\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. To-day is\u2014\u201d\n",
        "516": "\u201cThere, there, there!\u201d with the impatient movement of her fingers. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t want to know. Are you ready to play?\u201d\nI was obliged to answer in some confusion, \u201cI don\u2019t think I am, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n",
        "517": "\u201cNot at cards again?\u201d she demanded, with a searching look.\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am; I could do that, if I was wanted.\u201d\n\u201cSince this house strikes you old and grave, boy,\u201d said Miss Havisham,\nimpatiently, \u201cand you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?\u201d\n",
        "518": "I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to\nfind for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.\n\u201cThen go into that opposite room,\u201d said she, pointing at the door\nbehind me with her withered hand, \u201cand wait there till I come.\u201d\nI crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.\n",
        "519": "From that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had\nan airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in\nthe damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than\nto burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed\ncolder than the clearer air,\u2014like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry\nbranches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the\nchamber; or it would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its\ndarkness. It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but\n",
        "520": "every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and\ndropping to pieces. The most prominent object was a long table with a\ntablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the\nhouse and the clocks all stopped together. An epergne or centre-piece\nof some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily\noverhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and,\nas I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its\nseeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with\nblotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some\ncircumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in\nthe spider community.\n",
        "521": "I heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same\noccurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles\ntook no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a\nponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of\nhearing, and not on terms with one another.\nThese crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching\nthem from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.\n",
        "522": "In her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned,\nand she looked like the Witch of the place.\n\u201cThis,\u201d said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, \u201cis where\nI will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.\u201d\nWith some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and\nthere and die at once, the complete realisation of the ghastly waxwork\nat the Fair, I shrank under her touch.\n",
        "523": "\u201cWhat do you think that is?\u201d she asked me, again pointing with her\nstick; \u201cthat, where those cobwebs are?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t guess what it is, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n",
        "524": "\u201cIt\u2019s a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!\u201d\nShe looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,\nleaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, \u201cCome, come, come!\nWalk me, walk me!\u201d\n",
        "525": "I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss\nHavisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and\nshe leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have\nbeen an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.\nPumblechook\u2019s chaise-cart.\n",
        "526": "She was not physically strong, and after a little time said, \u201cSlower!\u201d\nStill, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she\ntwitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to\nbelieve that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast. After a\nwhile she said, \u201cCall Estella!\u201d so I went out on the landing and roared\n",
        "527": "that name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her light\nappeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round\nand round the room.\nIf only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should\nhave felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her the\nthree ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do.

        "530": "obnoxious to Camilla.\n\u201cThank you, Miss Havisham,\u201d she returned, \u201cI am as well as can be\nexpected.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding\n",

        "535": "The Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and\nhim I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at this\npoint, and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, \u201cCamilla, my\ndear, it is well known that your family feelings are gradually\nundermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than\nthe other.\u201d\n\u201cI am not aware,\u201d observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but\nonce, \u201cthat to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that\nperson, my dear.\u201d\n",

        "537": "\u201cOh, yes, yes!\u201d cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to\nrise from her legs to her bosom. \u201cIt\u2019s all very true! It\u2019s a weakness\nto be so affectionate, but I can\u2019t help it. No doubt my health would be\n",
        "538": "much better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn\u2019t change my disposition\nif I could. It\u2019s the cause of much suffering, but it\u2019s a consolation to\nknow I possess it, when I wake up in the night.\u201d Here another burst of\nfeeling.\n",
        "539": "Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going\nround and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the\nvisitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.\n\u201cThere\u2019s Matthew!\u201d said Camilla. \u201cNever mixing with any natural ties,\nnever coming here to see how Miss Havisham is!

I was quite\nas dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that\nafter-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe\nwhile my indentures lasted. It is about the only thing I _am_ glad to\nknow of myself in that connection.\n",
        "649": "For, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I\nproceed to add was Joe\u2019s.

How can _I_ say, when I never knew?

At those times, I would decide conclusively that my\ndisaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was\ngrowing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company\nwith Biddy,\u2014when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the\nHavisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and\nscatter my wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and\noften before I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in\nall directions by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss\nHavisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out.\n",

As I put the window open and stood looking out, I\nsaw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or\ntwo in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and\nlight it for him.

Therefore, I made\nno remark on Joe\u2019s first head; merely saying as to his second, that the\ntidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a\ngentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I\nwere one.\n",

        "1266": "Wemmick\u2019s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of\ngarden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery\nmounted with guns.\n\u201cMy own doing,\u201d said Wemmick. \u201cLooks pretty; don\u2019t it?\u201d\nI highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw;\nwith the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of them\nsham), and a gothic door almost too small to get in at.\n",
        "1267": "\u201cThat\u2019s a real flagstaff, you see,\u201d said Wemmick, \u201cand on Sundays I run\nup a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I\nhoist it up\u2014so\u2014and cut off the communication.\u201d\nThe bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and\ntwo deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he\n",
        "1268": "hoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish and\nnot merely mechanically.\n\u201cAt nine o\u2019clock every night, Greenwich time,\u201d said Wemmick, \u201cthe gun\nfires. There he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I think you\u2019ll\nsay he\u2019s a Stinger.\u201d\n",
        "1269": "The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,\nconstructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an\ningenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.\n\u201cThen, at the back,\u201d said Wemmick, \u201cout of sight, so as not to impede\nthe idea of fortifications,\u2014for it\u2019s a principle with me, if you have\nan idea, carry it out and keep it up,\u2014I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s your\nopinion\u2014\u201d\nI said, decidedly.\n",
        "1270": "\u201c\u2014At the back, there\u2019s a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, I\nknock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and\nyou\u2019ll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir,\u201d said\nWemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, \u201cif\nyou can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of\na time in point of provisions.\u201d\nThen, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was\napproached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long\ntime to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.\n",
        "1271": "Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower\nwas raised. This piece of water (with an island in the middle which\nmight have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and he\nhad constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill\ngoing and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent\nthat it made the back of your hand quite wet.\n\u201cI am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and my\nown gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,\u201d said Wemmick, in\nacknowledging my compliments. \u201cWell; it\u2019s a good thing, you know. It\n",

        "1273": "I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. There we\nfound, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean,\ncheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.\n\u201cWell aged parent,\u201d said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordial\nand jocose way, \u201chow am you?\u201d\n",

        "1278": "bestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in\nthe arbour; where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that it had\ntaken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present\npitch of perfection.\n\u201cIs it your own, Mr. Wemmick?\u201d\n\u201cO yes,\u201d said Wemmick, \u201cI have got hold of it, a bit at a time.

        "1280": "Never heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life is\nanother. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and\nwhen I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it\u2019s not\n",

        "1282": "talking, until it was almost nine o\u2019clock. \u201cGetting near gun-fire,\u201d\nsaid Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; \u201cit\u2019s the Aged\u2019s treat.\u201d\nProceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,\nwith expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great\nnightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the\n",
        "1283": "moment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and\nrepair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the\nStinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a\ncottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup\nin it ring. Upon this, the Aged\u2014who I believe would have been blown out\nof his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows\u2014cried out exultingly,\n\u201cHe\u2019s fired! I heerd him!\u201d and I nodded at the old gentleman until it\n",
        "1284": "is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.\nThe interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me\nhis collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious\ncharacter; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been\ncommitted, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and\nseveral manuscript confessions written under condemnation,\u2014upon which\nMr. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, \u201cevery\n",
        "1285": "one of \u2019em Lies, sir.\u201d These were agreeably dispersed among small\nspecimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the\nproprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged.\nThey were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had\nbeen first inducted, and which served, not only as the general\nsitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan\non the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the\nsuspension of a roasting-jack.\n",
        "1286": "There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged\nin the day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered\nto give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper\nwas excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot\ninsomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have\nbeen farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment.\n",
        "1287": "Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there\nbeing such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when\nI lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that\npole on my forehead all night.\nWemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him\ncleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from\nmy gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in a\nmost devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at\n",
        "1288": "half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees,\nWemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened\ninto a post-office again. At last, when we got to his place of business\nand he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as\nunconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the\ndrawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the Aged,\nhad all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the\nStinger.\n",
        "1289": "Chapter XXVI.\nIt fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early\nopportunity of comparing my guardian\u2019s establishment with that of his\ncashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with\nhis scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he\ncalled me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends\nwhich Wemmick had prepared me to receive. \u201cNo ceremony,\u201d he stipulated,\n",
        "1290": "\u201cand no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.\u201d I asked him where we should\ncome to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his\ngeneral objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,\n\u201cCome here, and I\u2019ll take you home with me.\u201d I embrace this opportunity\nof remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or\na dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose,\n",
        "1291": "which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer\u2019s shop. It had an\nunusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would\nwash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel,\nwhenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his\nroom. When I and my friends repaired to him at six o\u2019clock next day, he\nseemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than\nusual, for we found him with his head butted into this closet, not only\nwashing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat. And\n",
        "1292": "even when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel,\nhe took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before\nhe put his coat on.\nThere were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into\nthe street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was\nsomething so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his\npresence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along\nwestward, he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of\nthe streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he\nnever otherwise recognised anybody, or took notice that anybody\nrecognised him.\n",
        "1293": "He conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side\nof that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in\nwant of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and\nopened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and\nlittle used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark\n",
        "1294": "brown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the\npanelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know\nwhat kind of loops I thought they looked like.\nDinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his\ndressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the\n",
        "1295": "whole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was\ncomfortably laid\u2014no silver in the service, of course\u2014and at the side of\nhis chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and\ndecanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed\nthroughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed\neverything himself.\n",
        "1296": "There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,\nthat they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography,\ntrials, acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very\nsolid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however,\nand there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a\n",
        "1297": "little table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring\nthe office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an\nevening and fall to work.\nAs he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,\u2014for he and I had\nwalked together,\u2014he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,\nand took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to\nbe principally if not solely interested in Drummle.\n",
        "1298": "\u201cPip,\u201d said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to\nthe window, \u201cI don\u2019t know one from the other. Who\u2019s the Spider?\u201d\n\u201cThe spider?\u201d said I.\n\u201cThe blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.\u201d\n",

I like the look of that\nfellow.\u201d\n",
        "1300": "He immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his\nreplying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to\nscrew discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came\nbetween me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.\nShe was a woman of about forty, I supposed,\u2014but I may have thought her\nyounger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely\n",
        "1301": "pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot\nsay whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be\nparted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious\nexpression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see\nMacbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked\nto me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had\nseen rise out of the Witches\u2019 caldron.\nShe set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a\nfinger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats\n",
        "1302": "at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,\nwhile Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the\nhousekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice\nmutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all\nthe accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our\nhost from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the\ntable, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean\n",
        "1303": "plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just\ndisused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant\nthan the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw\nin her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made\n",
        "1304": "a dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other\nnatural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass\nbehind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.\nInduced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own\nstriking appearance and by Wemmick\u2019s preparation, I observed that\nwhenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my\nguardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put\nbefore him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and\nwanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I\nfancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and\na purpose of always holding her in suspense.\n",
        "1305": "Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather\nthan originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of\nour dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing\nmy tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and to\nboast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my\nlips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the\ndevelopment of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious\nway at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.\n",
        "1306": "It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our\nconversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied\nfor coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.\nDrummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to\nour company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that\nas to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible\nagency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity\nabout this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show\nhow muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in\na ridiculous manner.\n",
        "1307": "Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,\ntaking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,\nwas leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and\nshowing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.\nSuddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper\u2019s, like a trap,\nas she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do\nthis, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.\n",
        "1308": "\u201cIf you talk of strength,\u201d said Mr. Jaggers, \u201c_I_\u2019ll show you a wrist.\nMolly, let them see your wrist.\u201d\nHer entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other\nhand behind her waist. \u201cMaster,\u201d she said, in a low voice, with her\n",

Occasionally, he shot himself out of his\nequipage headforemost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasion\ndeliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way\u2014like\ncoals.

When we gradually fell into\nkeeping late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him\nwith a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look about\nhim more hopefully about midday; that he drooped when he came into\ndinner; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather\nclearly, after dinner; that he all but realised Capital towards\nmidnight; and that at about two o\u2019clock in the morning, he became so\ndeeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to\nAmerica, with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his\nfortune.\n",

Probably, it\ntook about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may\nhave been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in\nvarious stages of decay.\n",
