LOVECRAFT\nI am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow\nmy advice without knowing why. It is altogether against my will that\nI tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion of the\nantarctic--with its vast fossil hunt and its wholesale boring and\nmelting of the ancient ice caps. And I am the more reluctant because my\n",
        "2": "warning may be in vain.\nDoubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet,\nif I suppressed what will seem extravagant and incredible there would\nbe nothing left. The hitherto withheld photographs, both ordinary\nand a\u00ebrial, will count in my favor, for they are damnably vivid and\ngraphic. Still, they will be doubted because of the great lengths to\n",
        "3": "which clever fakery can be carried. The ink drawings, of course, will\nbe jeered at as obvious impostures; notwithstanding a strangeness and\ntechnique which art experts ought to remark and puzzle over.\nIn the end I must rely on the judgment and standing of the few\nscientific leaders who have, on the one hand, sufficient independence\nof thought to weigh my data on its own hideously convincing merits or\nin the light of certain primordial and highly baffling myth cycles;\nand on the other hand, sufficient influence to deter the exploring\nworld in general from any rash and over-ambitious program in the region\nof those mountains of madness.\n",
        "4": "It is an unfortunate fact that relatively obscure men like myself and\nmy associates, connected only with a small university, have little\nchance of making an impression where matters of a wildly bizarre or\nhighly controversial natures are concerned.\nIt is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense,\nspecialists in the fields which came primarily to be concerned. As a\ngeologist, my object in leading the Miskatonic University Expedition\nwas wholly that of securing deep-level specimens of rock and soil from\nvarious parts of the antarctic continent, aided by the remarkable drill\ndevised by Professor Frank H. Pabodie of our engineering department.\n",
        "5": "I had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this, but I did\nhope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points\nalong previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a\nsort hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of collection.\nPabodie's drilling apparatus, as the public already knows from our\nreports, was unique and radical in its lightness, portability, and\ncapacity to combine the ordinary Artesian drill principle with the\nprinciple of the small circular rock drill in such a way as to cope\nquickly with strata of varying hardness.\nSteel head, jointed rods, gasoline motor, collapsible wooden derrick,\ndynamiting paraphernalia, cording, rubbish-removal auger, and sectional\npiping for bores five inches wide and up to one thousand feet deep all\nformed, with needed accessories, no greater load than three seven-dog\nsledges could carry. This was made possible by the clever aluminum\n",
        "6": "alloy of which most of the metal objects were fashioned.\nFour large Dornier a\u00ebroplanes, designed especially for the tremendous\naltitude flying necessary on the antarctic plateau and with added\nfuel-warming and quick-starting devices worked out by Pabodie, could\ntransport our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great\nice barrier to various suitable inland points, and from these points a\nsufficient quota of dogs would serve us.\nWe planned to cover as great an area as one antarctic season--or\nlonger, if absolutely necessary--would permit, operating mostly in the\nmountain ranges and on the plateau south of Ross Sea; regions explored\nin varying degree by Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott, and Byrd. With\n",
        "7": "frequent changes of camp, made by a\u00ebroplane and involving distances\ngreat enough to be of geological significance, we expected to unearth a\nquite unprecedented amount of material--especially in the pre-Cambrian\nstrata of which so narrow a range of antarctic specimens had previously\nbeen secured.\nWe wished also to obtain as great as possible a variety of the upper\nfossiliferous rocks, since the primal life history of this bleak realm\nof ice and death is of the highest importance to our knowledge of the\nearth's past. That the antarctic continent was once temperate and\neven tropical, with a teeming vegetable and animal life of which the\nlichens, marine fauna, arachnida, and penguins of the northern edge are\nthe only survivors, is a matter of common information; and we hoped to\nexpand that information in variety, accuracy, and detail. When a simple\n",
        "8": "boring revealed fossiliferous signs, we would enlarge the aperture by\nblasting, in order to get specimens of suitable size and condition.\nOur borings, of varying depth according to the promise held out by the\nupper soil or rock, were to be confined to exposed, or nearly exposed,\nland surfaces--these inevitably being slopes and ridges because of the\nmile or two-mile thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels.\nWe could not afford to waste drilling depth on any considerable amount\nof more glaciation, though Pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking\ncopper electrodes in thick clusters of borings and melting off limited\nareas of ice with current from a gasoline-driven dynamo.\n",
        "9": "It is this plan--which we could not put into effect except\nexperimentally on an expedition such as ours--that the coming\nStarkweather-Moore Expedition proposes to follow, despite the warnings\nI have issued since our return from the antarctic.\n       *       *       *       *       *\nThe public knows of the Miskatonic Expedition through our frequent\nwireless reports to the _Arkham Advertiser_ and Associated Press, and\nthrough the later articles by Pabodie and myself. We consisted of four\nmen from the University--Pabodie, Lake of the biology department,\nAtwood of the physics department--also a meteorologist--and myself,\nrepresenting geology and having nominal command, also sixteen\nassistants: seven graduate students from Miskatonic and nine skilled\nmechanics.\n",
        "10": "Of these sixteen, twelve were qualified a\u00ebroplane pilots, all but two\nof whom were competent wireless operators. Eight of them understood\nnavigation with compass and sextant, as did Pabodie, Atwood and I. In\naddition, of course, our two ships--wooden exwhalers, reinforced for\nice conditions and having auxiliary steam--were fully manned.\n",
        "11": "The Nathaniel Derby Pickman Foundation, aided by a few special\ncontributions, financed the expedition; hence our preparations were\nextremely thorough, despite the absence of great publicity.\nThe dogs, sledges, machines, camp materials, and unassembled parts of\nour five planes were delivered in Boston, and there our ships were\nloaded.\nWe were marvelously well-equipped for our specific purposes, and in\nall matters pertaining to supplies, regimen, transportation, and camp\nconstruction we profited by the excellent example of our many recent\nand exceptionally brilliant predecessors. It was the unusual number and\n",
        "12": "fame of these predecessors which made our own expedition--ample though\nit was--so little noticed by the world at large.\nAs the newspapers told, we sailed from Boston Harbor on September 2nd,\n1930, taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the Panama\nCanal, and stopping at Samoa and Hobart, Tasmania, at which latter\nplace we took on final supplies.\nNone of our exploring party had ever been in the polar regions before,\nhence we all relied greatly on our ship captains--J. B. Douglas,\n",
        "13": "commanding the brig _Arkham_, and serving as commander of the sea\nparty, and Georg Thorfinnssen, commanding the barque _Miskatonic_--both\nveteran whalers in antarctic waters.\nAs we left the inhabited world behind the sun sank lower and lower in\nthe north, and stayed longer and longer above the horizon each day.\nAt about 62\u00b0 South Latitude we sighted our first icebergs--tablelike\nobjects with vertical sides--and just before reaching the antarctic\ncircle, which we crossed on October 20th with appropriately quaint\nceremonies, we were considerably troubled with field ice.\n",
        "14": "The falling temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage\nthrough the tropics, but I tried to brace up for the worse rigors to\ncome. On many occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me\nvastly; these included a strikingly vivid mirage--the first I had ever\nseen--in which distant bergs became the battlements of unimaginable\ncosmic castles.\nPushing through the ice, which was fortunately neither extensive\nnor thickly packed, we regained open water at South Latitude 67\u00b0,\nEast Longitude 175\u00b0. On the morning of October 26th a strong land\n",
        "15": "blink appeared on the south, and before noon we all felt a thrill of\nexcitement at beholding a vast, lofty, and snow-clad mountain chain\nwhich opened out and covered the whole vista ahead. At last we had\nencountered an outpost of the great unknown continent and its cryptic\nworld of frozen death.\nThese peaks were obviously the Admiralty Range discovered by Ross, and\nit would now be our task to round Cape Adare and sail down the east\ncoast of Victoria Land to our contemplated base on the shore of McMurdo\nSound, at the foot of the volcano Erebus in South Latitude 77\u00b0 9\u00b4.\n",
        "16": "       *       *       *       *       *\nThe last lap of the voyage was vivid and fancy-stirring. Great barren\npeaks of mystery loomed up constantly against the west as the low\nnorthern sun of noon or the still lower horizon-grazing southern sun of\nmidnight poured its hazy reddish rays over the white snow, bluish ice\nand water lanes, and black bits of exposed granite slope.\nThrough the desolate summits swept raging, intermittent gusts of\nthe terrible antarctic wind, whose cadences sometimes held vague\nsuggestions of a wild and half-sentient musical piping, with notes\nextending over a wide range, and which for some subconscious mnemonic\nreason seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible.\n",
        "17": "Something about the scene reminded me of the strange and disturbing\nAsian paintings of Nicholas Roerich, and of the still stranger and more\ndisturbing descriptions of the evilly fabled plateau of Leng which\noccur in the dreaded _Necronomicon_ of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. I\nwas rather sorry, later on, that I had ever looked into that monstrous\nbook at the college library.\nOn the 7th of November, sight of the westward range having been\ntemporarily lost, we passed Franklin Island; and the next day descried\nthe cones of Mts. Erebus and Terror on Ross Island ahead, with the long\n",
        "18": "line of the Parry Mountains beyond. There now stretched off to the east\nthe low, white line of the great ice barrier, rising perpendicularly\nto a height of two hundred feet like the rocky cliffs of Quebec, and\nmarking the end of southward navigation.\nIn the afternoon we entered McMurdo Sound and stood off the coast in\nthe lee of smoking Mt. Erebus. The scoriaceous peak towered up some\n",
        "19": "twelve thousand seven hundred feet against the eastern sky, like a\nJapanese print of the sacred Fujiyama, while beyond it rose the white,\nghostlike height of Mt. Terror, ten thousand nine hundred feet in\naltitude, and now extinct as a volcano.\nPuffs of smoke from Erebus came intermittently, and one of the graduate\nassistants--a brilliant young fellow named Danforth--pointed out what\nlooked like lava on the snowy slope, remarking that this mountain,\ndiscovered in 1840, had undoubtedly been the source of Poe's image\nwhen he wrote seven years later:\n      \"--the lavas that restlessly roll\n    Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek\n      In the ultimate climes of the pole--\n    That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek\n      In the realms of the boreal pole.\"\n",
        "20": "Danforth was a great reader of bizarre material, and had talked a\ngood deal of Poe. I was interested myself because of the antarctic\nscene of Poe's only long story--the disturbing and enigmatical _Arthur\nGordon Pym_. On the barren shore, and on the lofty ice barrier in the\nbackground, myriad of grotesque penguins squawked and flapped their\nfins, while many fat seals were visible on the water, swimming or\nsprawling across large cakes of slowly drifting ice.\n",
        "21": "Using small boats, we effected a difficult landing on Ross Island\nshortly after midnight, on the morning of the 9th, carrying a line of\ncable from each of the ships and preparing to unload supplies by means\nof a breeches-buoy arrangement.\nOur sensations on first treading antarctic soil were poignant and\ncomplex, even though at this particular point the Scott and Shackleton\nexpeditions had preceded us.\nOur camp on the frozen shore below the volcano's slope was only a\nprovisional one, headquarters being kept aboard the _Arkham_. We landed\n",
        "22": "all our drilling apparatus, dogs, sledges, tents, provisions, gasoline\ntanks, experimental ice-melting outfit, cameras, both ordinary and\na\u00ebrial, a\u00ebroplane parts, and other accessories, including three small\nportable wireless outfits--besides those in the planes--capable of\ncommunicating with the _Arkham's_ large outfit from any part of the\nantarctic continent that we would be likely to visit.\nThe ship's outfit, communicating with the outside world, was to convey\npress reports to the _Arkham Advertiser's_ powerful wireless station\non Kingsport Head, Mass. We hoped to complete our work during a single\nantarctic summer; but if this proved impossible we would winter on the\n_Arkham_, sending the _Miskatonic_ north before the freezing of the ice\nfor another summer's supplies.\n",
        "23": "       *       *       *       *       *\nI need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our\nearly work: of our ascent of Mt. Erebus; our successful mineral borings\nat several points on Ross Island and the singular speed with which\nPabodie's apparatus accomplished them, even through solid rock layers;\nour provisional test of the small ice-melting equipment; our perilous\nascent of the great barrier with sledges and supplies; and our final\nassembling of five huge a\u00ebroplanes at the camp atop the barrier.\nThe health of our land party--twenty men and fifty-five Alaskan sledge\ndogs--was remarkable, though of course we had so far encountered no\nreally destructive temperatures or windstorms.\n",
        "24": "For the most part, the thermometer varied between zero and 20\u00b0 or 25\u00b0\nabove, and our experience with New England winters had accustomed us to\nrigors of this sort. The barrier camp was semipermanent, and destined\nto be a storage cache for gasoline, provisions, dynamite, and other\nsupplies.\nOnly four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring\nmaterial, the fifth being left with a pilot and two men, from the\nships, at the storage cache to form a means of reaching us from the\n_Arkham_ in case all our exploring planes were lost.\n",
        "25": "Later, when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus, we\nwould employ one or two in a shuttle transportation service between\nthis cache and another permanent base on the great plateau from six\nhundred to seven hundred miles southward, beyond Beardmore Glacier.\nDespite the almost unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests\nthat pour down from the plateau, we determined to dispense with\nintermediate bases, taking our chances in the interest of economy and\nprobable efficiency.\nWireless reports have spoken of the breathtaking, four-hour, nonstop\nflight of our squadron on November 21st over the lofty shelf ice, with\nvast peaks rising on the west, and the unfathomed silences echoing to\nthe sound of our engines.\n",
        "26": "Wind troubled us only moderately, and our radio compasses helped us\nthrough the one opaque fog we encountered. When the vast rise loomed\nahead, between Latitudes 83\u00b0 and 84\u00b0, we knew we had reached Beardmore\nGlacier, the largest valley glacier in the world, and that the frozen\nsea was now giving place to a frowning and mountainous coast line.\nAt last we were truly entering the white, \u00e6on-dead world of the\nultimate south. Even as we realized it we saw the peak of Mt. Nansen\n",
        "27": "in the eastern distance, towering up to its height of almost fifteen\nthousand feet.\nThe successful establishment of the southern base above the glacier in\nLatitude 86\u00b0 7\u00b4, East Longitude 174\u00b0 23\u00b4, and the phenomenally rapid\nand effective borings and blastings made at various points reached by\nour sledge trips and short a\u00ebroplane flights, are matters of history;\nas is the arduous and triumphant ascent of Mt. Nansen by Pabodie and\ntwo of the graduate students--Gedney and Carroll--on December 13th to\n15th.\n",
        "28": "We were some eight thousand five hundred feet above sea-level. When\nexperimental drillings revealed solid ground only twelve feet down\nthrough the snow and ice at certain points, we made considerable use of\nthe small melting apparatus and sunk bores and performed dynamiting at\nmany places, where no previous explorer had ever thought of securing\nmineral specimens.\nThe pre-Cambrian granites and beacon sandstones thus obtained confirmed\nour belief that this plateau was homogeneous, with the great bulk of\nthe continent to the west, but somewhat different from the parts lying\neastward below South America--which we then thought to form a separate\nand smaller continent divided from the larger one by a frozen junction\nof Ross and Weddell Seas, though Byrd has since disproved the report.\n",
        "29": "In certain of the sandstones, dynamited and chiseled after boring\nrevealed their nature, we found some highly interesting fossil markings\nand fragments; notably ferns, seaweeds, trilobites, crinoids, and such\nmollusks as linguell\u00e6 and gastropods--all of which seemed of real\nsignificance in connection with the region's primordial history. There\nwas also a queer triangular, striated marking, about a foot in greatest\ndiameter, which Lake pieced together from three fragments of slate\nbrought up from a deep-blasted aperture.\nThese fragments came from a point to the westward, near the Queen\nAlexandra Range; and Lake, as a biologist, seemed to find their curious\nmarking unusually puzzling and provocative, though to my geological eye\nit looked not unlike some of the ripple effects reasonably common in\nthe sedimentary rocks.\n",
        "30": "Since slate is no more than a metamorphic formation into which a\nsedimentary stratum is pressed, and since the pressure itself produces\nodd distorting effects on any markings which may exist, I saw no reason\nfor extreme wonder over the striated depression.\n       *       *       *       *       *\nOn January 6, 1931, Lake, Pabodie, Daniels, all six of the students,\nfour mechanics, and myself flew directly over the south pole in two\nof the great planes, being forced down once by a sudden high wind,\nwhich, fortunately, did not develop into a typical storm. This was,\nas the papers have stated, one of several observation flights, during\nothers of which we tried to discern new topographical features in areas\nunreached by previous explorers.\n",
        "31": "Our early flights were disappointing in this latter respect, though\nthey afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly fantastic and\ndeceptive mirages of the polar regions, of which our sea voyage had\ngiven us some brief foretastes.\nDistant mountains floated in the sky as enchanted cities, and often the\nwhole white world would dissolve into a gold, silver, and scarlet land\nof Dunsanian dreams and adventurous expectancy under the magic of the\nlow midnight sun.\nOn cloudy days we had considerable trouble in flying, owing to the\ntendency of snowy earth and sky to merge into one mystical opalescent\nvoid with no visible horizon to mark the junction of the two.\n",
        "32": "At length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying five\nhundred miles eastward with all four exploring planes and establishing\na fresh sub-base at a point which would probably be on the smaller\ncontinental division, as we mistakenly conceived it. Geological\nspecimens obtained there would be desirable for purposes of comparison.\nOur health so far had remained excellent--lime juice well offsetting\nthe steady diet of tinned and salted food, and temperatures generally\nabove zero enabling us to do without our thickest furs.\n",
        "33": "It was now midsummer, and with haste and care we might be able to\nconclude work by March and avoid a tedious wintering through the long\nantarctic night. Several savage windstorms had burst upon us from the\nwest, but we had escaped damage through the skill of Atwood in devising\nrudimentary a\u00ebroplane shelters and windbreaks of heavy snow blocks, and\nin reinforcing the principal camp buildings with snow. Our good luck\nand efficiency had indeed been almost uncanny.\n",
        "34": "The outside world knew, of course, of our program, and was told also\nof Lake's strange and dogged insistence on a westward--or rather,\nnorthwestward--prospecting trip before our radical shift to the new\nbase.\nIt seems that he had pondered a great deal and with alarmingly radical\ndaring over that triangular striated marking in the slate; reading into\nit certain contradictions in nature and geological period which whetted\nhis curiosity to the utmost, and made him avid to sink more borings\nand blastings in the west-stretching formation to which the exhumed\nfragments evidently belonged.\nHe was strangely convinced that the marking was the print of some\nbulky, unknown, and radically unclassifiable organism of considerably\nadvanced evolution, notwithstanding that the rock which bore it was of\nso vastly ancient a date--Cambrian if not actually pre-Cambrian--as to\npreclude the probable existence not only of all highly evolved life,\nbut of any life at all above the unicellular or at most the trilobite\nstage. These fragments, with their odd marking, must have been five\n",
        "35": "hundred million to a thousand million years old.\n                                  II.\nPopular imagination, I judge, responded actively to our wireless\nbulletins of Lake's start northwestward into regions never trodden\nby human foot or penetrated by human imagination, though we did not\nmention his wild hopes of revolutionizing the entire sciences of\nbiology and geology.\n",
        "36": "His preliminary sledging and boring journey of January 11th to 18th\nwith Pabodie and five others--marred by the loss of two dogs in an\nupset when crossing one of the great pressure ridges in the ice--had\nbrought up more and more of the Arch\u00e6an slate; and even I was\ninterested by the singular profusion of evident fossil markings in that\nunbelievably ancient stratum.\nThese markings, however, were of very primitive life forms involving\nno great paradox except that any life forms should occur in rock as\ndefinitely pre-Cambrian as this seemed to be; hence I still failed to\nsee the good sense of Lake's demand for an interlude in our time-saving\nprogram--an interlude requiring the use of all four planes, many men,\nand the whole of the expedition's mechanical apparatus.\nI did not, in the end, veto the plan, though I decided not to accompany\nthe northwestward party despite Lake's plea for my geological advice.\n",
        "37": "While they were gone, I would remain at the base with Pabodie and five\nmen and work out final plans for the eastward shift. In preparation for\nthis transfer, one of the planes had begun to move up a good gasoline\nsupply from McMurdo Sound; but this could wait temporarily. I kept\nwith me one sledge and nine dogs, since it is unwise to be at any time\nwithout possible transportation in an utterly tenantless world of\n\u00e6on-long death.\n",
        "38": "Lake's subexpedition into the unknown, as every one will recall, sent\nout its own reports from the short-wave transmitters on the planes;\nthese being simultaneously picked up by our apparatus at the southern\nbase and by the _Arkham_ at McMurdo Sound, whence they were relayed to\nthe outside world on wave lengths up to fifty meters.\nThe start was made January 22nd at 4 a.m.; and the first wireless\nmessage we received came only two hours later, when Lake spoke of\ndescending and starting a small-scale ice-melting and bore at a point\nsome three hundred miles away from us. Six hours after that a second\n",
        "39": "and very excited message told of the frantic, beaverlike work whereby a\nshallow shaft had been sunk and blasted, culminating in the discovery\nof slate fragments with several markings approximately like the one\nwhich had caused the original puzzlement.\nThree hours later a brief bulletin announced the resumption of the\nflight in the teeth of a raw and piercing gale; and when I dispatched\na message of protest against further hazards, Lake replied curtly that\nhis new specimens made any hazard worth taking.\nI saw that his excitement had reached the point of mutiny, and that I\ncould do nothing to check this headlong risk of the whole expedition's\nsuccess; but it was appalling to think of his plunging deeper and\ndeeper into that treacherous and sinister white immensity of tempests\nand unfathomed mysteries which stretched off for some fifteen hundred\nmiles to the half-known, half-suspected coast line of Queen Mary and\nKnox Lands.\n",
        "40": "       *       *       *       *       *\nThen, in about an hour and a half more, came that doubly excited\nmessage from Lake's moving plane, which almost reversed my sentiments\nand made me wish I had accompanied the party:\n    \"10:05 p.m. On the wing. After snowstorm, have spied mountain range\n    ahead higher than any hitherto seen. May equal Himalayas, allowing\n    for height of plateau.

        "42": "After that Pabodie, the men, and I hung breathlessly over the receiver.\nThought of this titanic mountain rampart seven hundred miles away\ninflamed our deepest sense of adventure; and we rejoiced that our\nexpedition, if not ourselves personally, had been its discoverers. In\nhalf an hour Lake called us again:\n    \"Moulton's plane forced down on plateau in foothills, but nobody\n    hurt and perhaps can repair. Shall transfer essentials to other\n",

        "47": "Though it was technically sleeping time, not one of us listeners\nthought for a moment of retiring. It must have been a good deal\nthe same at McMurdo Sound, where the supply cache and the _Arkham_\nwere also getting the messages; for Captain Douglas gave out a call\ncongratulating everybody on the important find, and Sherman, the cache\noperator, seconded his sentiments. We were sorry, of course, about the\ndamaged a\u00ebroplane, but hoped it could be easily mended. Then, at eleven\n",
        "48": "p.m., came another call from Lake:\n    \"Up with Carroll over highest foothills. Don't dare try really tall\n    peaks in present weather, but shall later. Frightful work climbing,\n",
        "49": "    and hard going at this altitude, but worth it. Great range fairly\n    solid, hence can't get any glimpses beyond. Main summits exceed\n    Himalayas, and very queer. Range looks like pre-Cambrian slate,\n",

        "54": "    caves, but no flying danger so far.\"\nFrom then on for another half hour Lake kept up a running fire of\ncomment, and expressed his intention of climbing some of the peaks on\nfoot. I replied that I would join him as soon as he could send a plane,\nand that Pabodie and I would work out the best gasoline plan--just\nwhere and how to concentrate our supply in view of the expedition's\naltered character.\n",
        "55": "Obviously, Lake's boring operations, as well as his a\u00ebroplane\nactivities, would need a great deal delivered at the new base which\nhe was to establish at the foot of the mountains; and it was possible\nthat the eastward flight might not be made, after all, this season. In\nconnection with this business I called Captain Douglas and asked him to\nget as much as possible out of the ships and up the barrier with the\nsingle dog team we had left there. A direct route across the unknown\nregion between Lake and McMurdo Sound was what we really ought to\nestablish.\n",
        "56": "Lake called me later to say that he had decided to let the camp stay\nwhere Moulton's plane had been forced down, and where repairs had\nalready progressed somewhat. The ice sheet was very thin, with dark\nground here and there visible, and he would sink some borings and\nblasts at that very point before making any sledge trips or climbing\nexpeditions.\nHe spoke of the ineffable majesty of the whole scene, and the queer\nstate of his sensations at being in the lee of vast, silent pinnacles,\nwhose ranks shot up like a wall reaching the sky at the world's rim.\n",
        "57": "[Illustration: _It was a queer state of sensations--being in the lee of\nvast, silent pinnacles, where ranks shot up like a wall reaching the\nsky at the world's rim._]\nAtwood's theodolite observations had placed the height of the five\ntallest peaks at from thirty thousand to thirty-four thousand feet.\nThe windswept nature of the terrain clearly disturbed Lake, for it\nargued the occasional existence of prodigious gales, violent beyond\nanything we had so far encountered. His camp lay a little more than\n",
        "58": "five miles from where the higher foothills rose abruptly.\nI could almost trace a note of subconscious alarm in his words--flashed\nacross a glacial void of seven hundred miles--as he urged that we all\nhasten with the matter and get the strange, new region disposed of as\nsoon as possible. He was about to rest now, after a continuous day's\nwork of almost unparalleled speed, strenuousness, and results.\n",
        "59": "       *       *       *       *       *\nIn the morning I had a three-cornered wireless talk with Lake and\nCaptain Douglas at their widely separated bases. It was agreed that one\nof Lake's planes would come to my base for Pabodie, the five men, and\nmyself, as well as for all the fuel it could carry. The rest of the\nfuel question, depending on our decision about an easterly trip, could\nwait for a few days, since Lake had enough for immediate camp heat and\nborings.\n",
        "60": "Eventually the old southern base ought to be restocked, but if we\npostponed the easterly trip we would not use it till the next summer,\nand, meanwhile, Lake must send a plane to explore a direct route\nbetween his new mountains and McMurdo Sound.\nPabodie and I prepared to close our base for a short or long period, as\nthe case might be. If we wintered in the antarctic we would probably\nfly straight from Lake's base to the _Arkham_ without returning to\nthis spot. Some of our conical tents had already been reinforced by\n",
        "61": "blocks of hard snow, and now we decided to complete the job of making a\npermanent village. Owing to a very liberal tent supply, Lake had with\nhim all that his base would need, even after our arrival. I wirelessed\nthat Pabodie and I would be ready for the northwestward move after one\nday's work and one night's rest.\n",
        "62": "Our labors, however, were not very steady after four p.m., for about\nthat time Lake began sending in the most extraordinary and excited\nmessages. His working day had started unpropitiously, since an\na\u00ebroplane survey of the nearly exposed rock surfaces showed an entire\nabsence of those Arch\u00e6an and primordial strata for which he was\nlooking, and which formed so great a part of the colossal peaks that\nloomed up at a tantalizing distance from the camp.\n",
        "63": "Most of the rocks glimpsed were apparently Jurassic and Comanchean\nsandstones and Permian and Triassic schists, with now and then a glossy\nblack outcropping suggesting a hard and slaty coal.\nThis rather discouraged Lake, whose plans all hinged on unearthing\nspecimens more than five hundred million years older. It was clear\nto him that in order to recover the Arch\u00e6an slate vein in which he\nhad found the odd markings, he would have to make a long sledge trip\nfrom these foothills to the steep slopes of the gigantic mountains\nthemselves.\n",
        "64": "He had resolved, nevertheless, to do some local boring as part of the\nexpedition's general program; hence, he set up the drill and put five\nmen to work with it while the rest finished settling the camp and\nrepairing the damaged a\u00ebroplane. The softest visible rock--a sandstone\nabout a quarter of a mile from the camp--had been chosen for the\nfirst sampling; and the drill made excellent progress without much\nsupplementary blasting.\nIt was about three hours afterward, following the first really heavy\nblast of the operation, that the shouting of the drill crew was heard;\nand that young Gedney--the acting foreman--rushed into the camp with\nthe startling news.\n",
        "65": "       *       *       *       *       *\nThey had struck a cave. Early in the boring the sandstone had given\nplace to a vein of Comanchean limestone, full of minute fossil\ncephalopods, corals, echini, and spirifera, and with occasional\nsuggestions of siliceous sponges and marine vertebrate bones--the\nlatter probably of teliosts, sharks, and ganoids.\nThis, in itself, was important enough, as affording the first\nvertebrate fossils the expedition had yet secured; but when shortly\nafterward the drill head dropped through the stratum into apparent\nvacancy, a wholly new and doubly intense wave of excitement spread\namong the excavators.\n",
        "66": "A good-sized blast had laid open the subterrane secret; and now,\nthrough a jagged aperture perhaps five feet across and three feet\nthick, there yawned before the avid searchers a section of shallow\nlimestone hollowing worn more than fifty million years ago by the\ntrickling ground waters of a bygone tropic world.\nThe hollowed layer was not more than seven or eight feet deep, but\nextended off indefinitely in all directions and had a fresh, slightly\nmoving air which suggested its membership in an extensive subterranean\nsystem. Its roof and floor were abundantly equipped with large\nstalactites and stalagmites, some of which met in columnar form.\n",
        "67": "But important above all else was the vast deposit of shells and bones,\nwhich in places nearly choked the passage. Washed down from unknown\njungles of Mesozoic tree ferns and fungi, and forests of Tertiary\ncycads, fan palms, and primitive angiosperms, this osseous medley\ncontained representatives of more Cretaceous, Eocene, and other\nanimal species than the greatest pal\u00e6ontologist could have counted or\nclassified in a year. Mollusks, crustacean armor, fishes, amphibians,\nreptiles, birds, and early mammals--great and small, known and unknown.\n",
        "68": "No wonder Gedney ran back to the camp shouting, and no wonder every one\nelse dropped work and rushed headlong through the biting cold to where\nthe tall derrick marked a new-found gateway to secrets of inner earth\nand vanished \u00e6ons.\nWhen Lake had satisfied the first keen edge of his curiosity he\nscribbled a message in his notebook and had young Moulton run back to\nthe camp to dispatch it by wireless.\nThis was my first word of the discovery, and it told of the\nidentification of early shells, bones of ganoids and placoderms,\nremnants of labyrinthodonta and thecoiidea, great mosasaur skull\nfragments, dinosaur vertebr\u00e6 and armor plates, pterodactyl teeth and\nwing bones, Archaeopteryx d\u00e9bris, Miocene sharks' teeth, primitive\nbird skulls, and other bones of archaic mammals such as Pal\u00e6otheres,\nXiphodons, Eohippi, Oreodons, and Titanotheriid\u00e6.\n",
        "69": "There was nothing as recent as a mastodon, elephant, true camel, deer,\nor bovine animal; hence Lake concluded that the last deposits had\noccurred during the Oligocene Age, and that the hollowed stratum had\nlain in its present dried, dead, and inaccessible state for at least\nthirty million years.\nOn the other hand, the prevalence of very early life forms was singular\nin the highest degree. Though the limestone formation was, on the\nevidence of such typical imbedded fossils as ventriculites, positively\nand unmistakably Comanchean and not a particle earlier; the free\nfragments in the hollow space included a surprising proportion from\norganisms hitherto considered as peculiar to far older periods--even\nrudimentary fishes, mollusks, and corals as remote as the Silurian or\nOrdovician.\n",
        "70": "The inevitable inference was that in this part of the world there had\nbeen a remarkable and unique degree of continuity between the life of\nover three hundred million years ago and that of only thirty million\nyears ago. How far this continuity had extended beyond the Oligocene\nAge when the cavern was closed was of course past all speculation.\nIn any event, the coming of the frightful ice in the Pleistocene some\nfive hundred thousand years ago--a mere yesterday as compared with the\nage of this cavity--must have put an end to any of the primal forms\nwhich had locally managed to outlive their common terms.\n",

After that Moulton stayed at the wireless in\none of the planes, transmitting to me--and to the _Arkham_ for relaying\nto the outside world--the frequent postscripts which Lake sent him by a\nsuccession of messengers.\nThose who followed the newspapers will remember the excitement created\namong men of science by that afternoon's reports--reports which have\nfinally led, after all these years, to the organization of that very\nStarkweather-Moore Expedition which I am so anxious to dissuade from\nits purposes.

He did, however,\nmove all the undissected specimens closer together and throw a spare\ntent over them in order to keep off the direct solar rays. That\nwould also help to keep their possible scent away from the dogs,\nwhose hostile unrest was really becoming a problem, even at their\nsubstantial distance and behind the higher and higher snow walls, which\nan increased quota of the men were hastening to raise around their\nquarters.\n",

These latter shelters, begun with hard snow blocks during odd\nmoments, were by no means as high as they should have been; and Lake\nfinally detached all hands from other tasks to work on them.\n",

Scattered\nbits of clothing, roughly slashed from the human incision subjects,\nhinted no clues.\n",
        "175": "It is useless to bring up the half impression of certain faint snow\nprints in one shielded corner of the ruined inclosure--because that\nimpression did not concern human prints at all, but was clearly\nmixed up with all the talk of fossil prints which poor Lake had been\ngiving throughout the preceding weeks. One had to be careful of one's\nimagination in the lee of those overshadowing mountains of madness.\nAs I have indicated, Gedney and one dog turned out to be missing in\nthe end. When we came on that terrible shelter we had missed two dogs\n",
        "176": "and two men; but the fairly unharmed dissecting tent, which we entered\nafter investigating the monstrous graves, had something to reveal.\nIt was not as Lake had left it, for the covered parts of the primal\nmonstrosity had been removed from the improvised table. Indeed, we had\nalready realized that one of the six imperfect and insanely buried\nthings we had found--the one with the trace of a peculiarly hateful\nodor--must represent the collected sections of the entity which Lake\nhad tried to analyze.\n",
        "177": "On and around that laboratory table were strewn other things, and it\ndid not take long for us to guess that those things were the carefully,\nthough oddly and inexpertly dissected parts of one man and one dog. I\nshall spare the feelings of survivors by omitting mention of the man's\nidentity.\nLake's anatomical instruments were missing, but there were evidences\nof their careful cleansing. The gasoline stove was also gone, though\n",
        "178": "around it we found a curious litter of matches. We buried the human\nparts beside the other ten men, and the canine parts with the other\nthirty-five dogs. Concerning the bizarre smudges on the laboratory\ntable, and on the jumble of roughly handled illustrated books scattered\nnear it, we were much too bewildered to speculate.\n",
        "179": "This formed the worst of the camp horror, but other things were\nequally perplexing. The disappearance of Gedney, the one dog, the\neight uninjured biological specimens, the three sledges, and certain\ninstruments, illustrated technical and scientific books, writing\nmaterials, electric torches and batteries, food and fuel, heating\napparatus, spare tents, fur suits, and the like, was utterly beyond\nsane conjecture; as were likewise the spatter-fringed ink blots on\ncertain pieces of paper, and the evidences of curious alien fumbling\nand experimentation around the planes and all other mechanical devices\nboth at the camp and at the boring. The dogs seemed to abhor this oddly\ndisordered machinery.\n",
        "180": "Then, too, there was the upsetting of the larder, the disappearance\nof certain staples, and the jarringly comical heap of tin cans pried\nopen in the most unlikely ways and at the most unlikely places. The\nprofusion of scattered matches, intact, broken, or spent, formed\nanother minor enigma--as did the two or three tent cloths and fur suits\nwhich we found lying about with peculiar and unorthodox slashings\nconceivably due to clumsy efforts at unimaginable adaptations.\nThe maltreatment of the human and canine bodies, and the crazy burial\nof the damaged arch\u00e6an specimens, were all of a piece with this\napparent disintegrative madness. In view of just such an eventuality\n",
        "181": "as the present one, we carefully photographed all the main evidences\nof insane disorder at the camp; and shall use the prints to buttress\nour pleas against the departure of the proposed Starkweather-Moore\nExpedition.\n       *       *       *       *       *\nOur first act after finding the bodies in the shelter was to photograph\nand open the row of insane graves with the five-pointed snow mounds.\nWe could not help noticing the resemblance of these monstrous mounds,\nwith their clusters of grouped dots, to poor Lake's descriptions of the\nstrange greenish soapstones; and when we came on some of the soapstones\nthemselves in the great mineral pile we found the likeness very close\nindeed.\n",
        "182": "The whole general formation, it must be made clear, seemed abominably\nsuggestive of the starfish head of the arch\u00e6an entities; and we agreed\nthat the suggestion must have worked potently upon the sensitized minds\nof Lake's overwrought party.\nFor madness--centering in Gedney as the only possible surviving\nagent--was the explanation spontaneously adopted by everybody so far\nas spoken utterance was concerned; though I will not be so na\u00efve as\nto deny that each of us may have harbored wild guesses which sanity\nforbade him to formulate completely.\nSherman, Pabodie, and McTighe made an exhaustive a\u00ebroplane cruise over\nall the surrounding territory in the afternoon, sweeping the horizon\nwith field glasses in quest of Gedney and of the various missing\nthings; but nothing came to light.\n",
        "183": "The party reported that the titan-barrier range extended endlessly to\nright and left alike, without any diminution in height or essential\nstructure. On some of the peaks, though, the regular cube and rampart\nformations were bolder and plainer, having doubly fantastic similitudes\nto Roerich-painted Asian hill ruins. The distribution of cryptical cave\nmouths on the black snow-denuded summits seemed roughly even as far as\nthe range could be traced.\n",
        "184": "In spite of all the prevailing horrors we were left with enough sheer\nscientific zeal and adventurousness to wonder about the unknown realm\nbeyond those mysterious mountains.\nAs our guarded messages stated, we rested at midnight after our day of\nterror and bafflement--but not without a tentative plan for one or more\nrange-crossing altitude flights in a lightened plane with a\u00ebrial camera\nand geologist's outfit, beginning the following morning.\nIt was decided that Danforth and I try it first, and we awaked at seven\na.m. intending an early trip; though heavy winds--mentioned in our\n",
        "185": "brief bulletin to the outside world--delayed our start till nearly nine\no'clock.\nI have already repeated the noncommittal story we told the men at\ncamp--and relayed outside--after our return sixteen hours later.\nIt is now my terrible duty to amplify this account by filling in\nthe merciful blanks with hints of what we really saw in that hidden\ntransmontane world--hints of the revelations which have finally driven\nDanforth to a nervous collapse.\n",
        "186": "I wish he would add a really frank word about the thing which he thinks\nhe alone saw--even though it was probably a nervous delusion--and which\nwas perhaps the last straw that put him where he is; but he is firm\nagainst that. All I can do is to repeat his later disjointed whispers\nabout what set him shrieking as the plane soared back through the\nwind-tortured mountain pass after that real and tangible shock which I\nshared.\nThis will form my last word. If the plain signs of surviving elder\n",
        "187": "horrors in what I disclose be not enough to keep others from meddling\nwith the inner antarctic--or at least from prying too deeply beneath\nthe surface of that ultimate waste of forbidden secrets and unhuman,\n\u00e6on-cursed desolation--the responsibility for unnamable and perhaps\nimmeasurable evils will not be mine.\n       *       *       *       *       *\nDanforth and I, studying the notes made by Pabodie in his afternoon\nflight and checking up with a sextant, had calculated that the lowest\navailable pass in the range lay somewhat to the right of us, within\nsight of camp, and about twenty-three thousand or twenty-four thousand\nfeet above sea-level. For this point, then, we first headed in the\nlightened plane as we embarked on our flight of discovery.\n",
        "188": "The camp itself, on foothills which sprang from a high continental\nplateau, was some twelve thousand feet in altitude; hence the\nactual height increase necessary was not so vast as it might seem.\nNevertheless we were acutely conscious of the rarefied air and intense\ncold as we rose; for, on account of visibility conditions, we had\nto leave the cabin windows open. We were dressed, of course, in our\nheaviest furs.\n",
        "189": "As we drew near the forbidding peaks, dark and sinister above the\nline of crevasse-riven snow and interstitial glaciers, we noticed more\nand more the curiously regular formations clinging to the slopes; and\nthought again of the strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich.\nThe ancient and wind-weathered rock strata fully verified all of\nLake's bulletins, and proved that these pinnacles had been towering\nup in exactly the same way since a surprisingly early time in earth's\nhistory--perhaps over fifty million years. How much higher they had\nonce been, it was futile to guess; but everything about this strange\nregion pointed to obscure atmospheric influences unfavorable to\nchange, and calculated to retard the usual climatic processes of rock\ndisintegration.\n",
        "190": "But it was the mountainside tangle of regular cubes, ramparts, and cave\nmouths which fascinated and disturbed us most. I studied them with a\nfield glass and took a\u00ebrial photographs while Danforth drove; and at\ntimes I relieved him at the controls--though my aviation knowledge was\npurely an amateur's--in order to let him use the binoculars.\nWe could easily see that much of the material of the things was a\nlightish arch\u00e6an quartzite, unlike any formation visible over broad\nareas of the general surface; and that their regularity was extreme and\nuncanny to an extent which poor Lake had scarcely hinted.\n",
        "191": "As he had said, their edges were crumbled and rounded from untold\n\u00e6ons of savage weathering; but their preternatural solidity and tough\nmaterial had saved them from obliteration. Many parts, especially\nthose closest to the slopes, seemed identical in substance with the\nsurrounding rock surface.\nThe whole arrangement looked like the ruins of Macchu Picchu in\nthe Andes, or the primal foundation walls of Kish as dug up by the\nOxford-Field Museum Expedition in 1929; and both Danforth and I\nobtained that occasional impression of separate Cyclopean blocks which\nLake had attributed to his flight-companion Carroll.\n",
        "192": "How to account for such things in this place was frankly beyond me, and\nI felt queerly humbled as a geologist. Igneous formations often have\nstrange regularities--like the famous Giants' Causeway in Ireland--but\nthis stupendous range, despite Lake's original suspicion of smoking\ncones, was above all else nonvolcanic in evident structure.\nThe curious cave mouths, near which the odd formation seemed most\nabundant, presented another, albeit a lesser puzzle because of their\nregularity of outline. They were, as Lake's bulletin had said, often\n",
        "193": "approximately square or semicircular; as if the natural orifices had\nbeen shaped to greater symmetry by some magic hand. Their numerousness\nand wide distribution were remarkable, and suggested that the whole\nregion was honeycombed with tunnels dissolved out of limestone strata.\nSuch glimpses as we secured did not extend far within the caverns, but\nwe saw that they were apparently clear of stalactites and stalagmites.\n",
        "194": "Outside, those parts of the mountain slopes adjoining the apertures\nseemed invariably smooth and regular; and Danforth thought that the\nslight cracks and pittings of the weathering tended toward unusual\npatterns.\nFilled as he was with the horrors and strangenesses discovered at the\ncamp, he hinted that the pittings vaguely resembled those baffling\ngroups of dots sprinkled over the primeval greenish soapstones, so\nhideously duplicated on the madly conceived snow mounds above those six\nburied monstrosities.\n       *       *       *       *       *\nWe had risen gradually in flying over the higher foothills and along\ntoward the relatively low pass we had selected. As we advanced we\n",
        "195": "occasionally looked down at the snow and ice of the land route,\nwondering whether we could have attempted the trip with the simpler\nequipment of earlier days.\nSomewhat to our surprise we saw that the terrain was far from difficult\nas such things go; and that despite the crevasses and other bad spots\nit would not have been likely to deter the sledges of a Scott, a\nShackleton, or an Amundsen. Some of the glaciers appeared to lead up to\nwind-bared passes with unusual continuity, and upon reaching our chosen\npass we found that its case formed no exception.\n",
        "196": "Our sensations of tense expectancy as we prepared to round the crest\nand peer out over an untrodden world can hardly be described on paper;\neven though we had no cause to think the regions beyond the range\nessentially different from those already seen and traversed. The touch\nof evil mystery in these barrier mountains, and in the beckoning sea of\nopalescent sky glimpsed betwixt their summits, was a highly subtle and\nattenuated matter not to be explained in literal words. Rather was it\nan affair of vague psychological symbolism and \u00e6sthetic association--a\nthing mixed up with exotic poetry and paintings, and with archaic myths\nlurking in shunned and forbidden volumes.\n",
        "197": "Even the wind's burden held a peculiar strain of conscious malignity;\nand for a second it seemed that the composite sound included a bizarre\nmusical whistling, or piping over a wide range as the blast swept in\nand out of the omnipresent and resonant cave mouths. There was a cloudy\nnote of reminiscent repulsion in this sound, as complex and unplaceable\nas any of the other dark impressions.\nWe were now, after a slow ascent, at a height of twenty-three thousand\nfive hundred and seventy feet according to the aneroid; and had left\nthe region of clinging snow definitely below us. Up here were only\n",
        "198": "dark, bare rock slopes and the start of rough-ribbed glaciers--but with\nthose provocative cubes, ramparts, and echoing cave mouths to add a\nportent of the unnatural, the fantastic, and the dreamlike.\nLooking along the line of high peaks, I thought I could see the one\nmentioned by poor Lake, with a rampart exactly on top. It seemed to be\nhalf lost in a queer antarctic haze--such a haze, perhaps, as had been\nresponsible for Lake's early notion of volcanism.\n",
        "199": "The pass loomed directly before us, smooth and windswept between its\njagged and malignly frowning pylons. Beyond it was a sky fretted with\nswirling vapors and lighted by the low polar sun--the sky of that\nmysterious farther realm upon which we felt no human eye had ever gazed.\nA few more feet of altitude and we would behold that realm. Danforth\n",
        "200": "and I, unable to speak except in shouts amidst the howling, piping wind\nthat raced through the pass and added to the noise of the unmuffled\nengines, exchanged eloquent glances. And then, having gained those last\nfew feet, we did indeed stare across the momentous divide and over the\nunsampled secrets of an elder and utterly alien earth.\n                                  V.\n",
        "201": "I think that both of us simultaneously cried out in mixed awe, wonder,\nterror, and disbelief in our own senses as we finally cleared the pass\nand saw what lay beyond. Of course, we must have had some natural\ntheory in the back of our heads to steady our faculties for the moment.\nProbably we thought of such things as the grotesquely weathered stones\nof the Garden of the Gods in Colorado, or the fantastically symmetrical\nwind-carved rocks of the Arizona desert. Perhaps we even half thought\n",
        "202": "the sight a mirage like that we had seen the morning before on first\napproaching those mountains of madness.\nWe must have had some such normal notions to fall back upon as our\neyes swept that limitless, tempest-scarred plateau and grasped the\nalmost endless labyrinth of colossal, regular, and geometrically\neurythmic stone masses which reared their crumbled and pitted crests\nabove a glacial sheet not more than forty or fifty feet deep at its\nthickest, and in places obviously thinner.\nThe effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable, for some fiendish\nviolation of known natural law seemed certain at the outset. Here,\n",
        "203": "on a hellishly ancient table-land fully twenty thousand feet high,\nand in a climate deadly to habitation since a prehuman age not less\nthan five hundred thousand years ago, there stretched nearly to the\nvision's limit a tangle of orderly stone which only the desperation of\nmental self-defense could possibly attribute to any but a conscious and\nartificial cause.\n[Illustration: _The effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable!\nSome fiendish violation of natural law!_]\n",
        "204": "We had previously dismissed, so far as serious thought was concerned,\nany theory that the cubes and ramparts of the mountainsides were other\nthan natural in origin.

Of course, the phantom had been\ntwisted and exaggerated, and had contained things which the real source\ndid not contain; yet now, as we saw that real source, we thought it\neven more hideous and menacing than its distant image.\n",

We had merely struck, at random, a limited part of\nsomething of incalculable extent.\n",
        "208": "The foothills were more sparsely sprinkled with grotesque stone\nstructures, linking the terrible city to the already familiar cubes and\nramparts which evidently formed its mountain outposts. These latter,\nas well as the queer cave mouths, were as thick on the inner as on the\nouter sides of the mountains.\nThe nameless stone labyrinth consisted, for the most part, of\nwalls from ten to one hundred and fifty feet in ice-clear height,\nand of a thickness varying from five to ten feet.

Our orientation flights had indicated that many\nbuildings in the city proper were less ice-choked, and that we might\nperhaps find wholly clear interiors leading down to the true ground\nlevel if we entered those structures still roofed at the top.\n",
        "227": "Before we left the rampart we photographed it carefully, and studied\nits mortarless Cyclopean masonry with complete bewilderment. We wished\nthat Pabodie were present, for his engineering knowledge might have\nhelped us guess how such titanic blocks could have been handled in that\nunbelievably remote age when the city and its outskirts were built up.\n       *       *       *       *       *\nThe half-mile walk downhill to the actual city, with the upper wind\nshrieking vainly and savagely through the skyward peaks in the\nbackground, was something of which the smallest details will always\nremain engraved on my mind.

It was a mirage in solid stone,\nand were it not for the photographs I would still doubt that such a\nthing could be. The general type of masonry was identical with that\n",
        "229": "of the rampart we had examined; but the extravagant shapes which this\nmasonry took in its urban manifestations were past all description.\nEven the pictures illustrate only one or two phases of its endless\nvariety, preternatural massiveness, and utterly alien exoticism. There\nwere geometrical forms for which an Euclid could scarcely find a\nname--cones of all degrees of irregularity and truncation, terraces\nof every sort of provocative disproportion, shafts with odd bulbous\nenlargements, broken columns in curious groups, and five-pointed or\nfive-ridged arrangements of mad grotesqueness.\n",
        "230": "As we drew nearer we could see beneath certain transparent parts of the\nice sheet, and detect some of the tubular stone bridges that connected\nthe crazily sprinkled structures at various heights. Of orderly streets\nthere seemed to be none, the only broad open swath being a mile to the\nleft, where the ancient river had doubtless flowed through the town\ninto the mountains.\nOur field glasses showed the external, horizontal bands of nearly\neffaced sculptures and dot groups to be very prevalent, and we could\nhalf imagine what the city must once have looked like--even though most\nof the roofs and tower tops had necessarily perished.\n",
        "231": "As a whole, it had been a complex tangle of twisted lanes and alleys,\nall of them deep canyons, and some little better than tunnels because\nof the overhanging masonry or overarching bridges.\nNow, outspread below us, it loomed like a dream phantasy against a\nwestward mist through whose northern end the low, reddish antarctic sun\nof early afternoon was struggling to shine; and when, for a moment,\nthat sun encountered a denser obstruction and plunged the scene into\ntemporary shadow, the effect was subtly menacing in a way I can never\nhope to depict. Even the faint howling and piping of the unfelt wind in\nthe great mountain passes behind us took on a wilder note of purposeful\nmalignity.\n",
        "232": "The last stage of our descent to the town was unusually steep and\nabrupt, and a rock outcropping at the edge where the grade changed led\nus to think that an artificial terrace had once existed there. Under\nthe glaciation, we believed, there must be a flight of steps or its\nequivalent.\nWhen at last we plunged into the town itself, clambering over fallen\nmasonry and shrinking from the oppressive nearness and dwarfing height\nof omnipresent crumbling and pitted walls, our sensations again became\nsuch that I marvel at the amount of self-control we retained.\n",
        "233": "Danforth was frankly jumpy, and began making some offensively\nirrelevant speculations about the horror at the camp--which I resented\nall the more because I could not help sharing certain conclusions\nforced upon us by many features of this morbid survival from nightmare\nantiquity.\nThe speculations worked on his imagination, too; for in one\nplace--where a d\u00e9bris-littered alley turned a sharp corner--he insisted\nthat he saw faint traces of ground markings which he did not like;\nwhilst elsewhere he stopped to listen to a subtle, imaginary sound\nfrom some undefined point--a muffled musical piping, he said, not\nunlike that of the wind in the mountain caves, yet somehow disturbingly\ndifferent.\nThe ceaseless five-pointedness of the surrounding architecture and\nof the few distinguishable mural arabesques had a dimly sinister\nsuggestiveness we could not escape, and gave us a touch of terrible\nsubconscious certainty concerning the primal entities which had reared\nand dwelt in this unhallowed place.\n",
        "234": "Nevertheless, our scientific and adventurous souls were not wholly\ndead, and we mechanically carried out our program of chipping specimens\nfrom all the different rock types represented in the masonry. We wished\na rather full set in order to draw better conclusions regarding the age\nof the place.\nNothing in the great outer walls seemed to date from later than the\nJurassic and Comanchean periods, nor was any piece of stone in the\nentire place of a greater recency than the Pliocene age. In stark\n",

Some were above our reach, whilst others led only into\nice-choked ruins as unroofed and barren as the rampart on the hill.\n",
        "236": "One, though spacious and inviting, opened on a seemingly bottomless\nabyss without visible means of descent. Now and then we had a chance to\nstudy the petrified wood of a surviving shutter, and were impressed by\nthe fabulous antiquity implied in the still discernible grain. These\nthings had come from Mesozoic gymnosperms and conifers--especially\nCretaceous cycads--and from fan palms and early angiosperms of plainly\nTertiary date. Nothing definitely later than the Pliocene could be\n",

They seemed to have become wedged in place, thus\nsurviving the rusting of their former and probably metallic fixtures\nand fastenings.\n",
        "238": "After a time we came across a row of windows--in the bulges of a\ncolossal five-edged cone of undamaged apex--which led into a vast,\nwell-preserved room with stone flooring; but these were too high in\nthe room to permit descent without a rope. We had a rope with us,\nbut did not wish to bother with this twenty-foot drop unless obliged\nto--especially in this thin plateau air where great demands were made\nupon the heart action.\nThis enormous room was probably a hall or concourse of some sort, and\nour electric torches showed bold, distinct, and potentially startling\nsculptures arranged round the walls in broad, horizontal bands\nseparated by equally broad strips of conventional arabesques. We took\n",
        "239": "careful note of this spot, planning to enter here unless a more easily\ngained interior was encountered.\nFinally, though, we did encounter exactly the opening we wished; an\narchway about six feet wide and ten feet high, marking the former end\nof an a\u00ebrial bridge which had spanned an alley about five feet above\nthe present level of glaciation. These archways, of course, were flush\nwith upper-story floors, and in this case one of the floors still\nexisted.\n",
        "240": "The building thus accessible was a series of rectangular terraces\non our left facing westward. That across the alley, where the other\narchway yawned, was a decrepit cylinder with no windows and with\na curious bulge about ten feet above the aperture. It was totally\ndark inside, and the archway seemed to open on a well of illimitable\nemptiness.\n",
        "241": "Heaped d\u00e9bris made the entrance to the vast left-hand building doubly\neasy, yet for a moment we hesitated before taking advantage of the\nlong-wished chance. For though we had penetrated into this tangle of\narchaic mystery, it required fresh resolution to carry us actually\ninside a complete and surviving building of a fabulous elder world\nwhose nature was becoming more and more hideously plain to us.\nIn the end, however, we made the plunge, and scrambled up over the\nrubble into the gaping embrasure. The floor beyond was of great slate\n",
        "242": "slabs, and seemed to form the outlet of a long, high corridor with\nsculptured walls.\nObserving the many inner archways which led off from it, and realizing\nthe probable complexity of the nest of apartments within, we decided\nthat we must begin our system of hare-and-hound trail blazing. Hitherto\nour compasses, together with frequent glimpses of the vast mountain\nrange between the towers in our rear, had been enough to prevent our\nlosing our way; but from now on, the artificial substitute would be\nnecessary.\n",
        "243": "Accordingly we reduced our extra paper to shreds of suitable size,\nplaced these in a bag to be carried by Danforth, and prepared to use\nthem as economically as safety would allow. This method would probably\ngain us immunity from straying, since there did not appear to be any\nstrong air currents inside the primordial masonry. If such should\ndevelop, or if our paper supply should give out, we could of course\nfall back on the more secure though more tedious and retarding method\nof rock chipping.\n",
        "244": "Just how extensive a territory we had opened up, it was impossible\nto guess without a trial. The close and frequent connection of the\ndifferent buildings made it likely that we might cross from one to\nanother on bridges underneath the ice, except where impeded by local\ncollapses and geologic rifts, for very little glaciation seemed to have\nentered the massive constructions.\nAlmost all the areas of transparent ice had revealed the submerged\nwindows as tightly shuttered, as if the town had been left in that\nuniform state until the glacial sheet came to crystallize the lower\npart for all succeeding time. Indeed, one gained a curious impression\n",
        "245": "that this place had been deliberately closed and deserted in some dim,\nbygone \u00e6on, rather than overwhelmed by any sudden calamity or even\ngradual decay. Had the coming of the ice been foreseen, and had a\nnameless population left _en masse_ to seek a less doomed abode?\nThe precise physiographic conditions attending the formation of the\nice sheet at this point would have to wait for later solution. It had\n",
        "246": "not, very plainly, been a grinding drive. Perhaps the pressure of\naccumulated snows had been responsible, and perhaps some flood from\nthe river, or from the bursting of some ancient glacial dam in the\ngreat range, had helped to create the special state now observable.\nImagination could conceive almost anything in connection with this\nplace.\n",
        "247": "                                  VI.\nIt would be cumbrous to give a detailed, consecutive account of\nour wanderings inside that cavernous, \u00e6on-dead honeycomb of primal\nmasonry--that monstrous lair of elder secrets which now echoed for the\nfirst time, after uncounted epochs, to the tread of human feet.\nThis is especially true because so much of the horrible drama and\nrevelation came from a mere study of the omnipresent mural carvings.\n",
        "248": "Our flash-light photographs of those carvings will do much toward\nproving the truth of what we are now disclosing, and it is lamentable\nthat we had not a larger film supply with us. As it was, we made crude\nnotebook sketches of certain salient features after all our films were\nused up.\nThe building which we had entered was one of great size and\nelaborateness, and gave us an impressive notion of the architecture of\nthat nameless geologic past. The inner partitions were less massive\n",
        "249": "than the outer walls, but on the lower levels were excellently\npreserved. Labyrinthine complexity, involving curiously irregular\ndifferences in floor levels, characterized the entire arrangement; and\nwe should certainly have been lost at the very outset but for the trail\nof torn paper left behind us.\nWe decided to explore the more decrepit upper parts first of all, hence\nclimbed aloft in the maze for a distance of some one hundred feet, to\nwhere the topmost tier of chambers yawned snowily and ruinously open to\nthe polar sky. Ascent was effected over the steep, transversely ribbed\n",
        "250": "stone ramps or inclined planes which everywhere served in lieu of\nstairs.\nThe rooms we encountered were of all imaginable shapes and proportions,\nranging from five-pointed stars to triangles and perfect cubes. It\nmight be safe to say that their general average was about 30 x 30 feet\nin floor area, and twenty feet in height, though many larger apartments\nexisted.\n",
        "251": "After thoroughly examining the upper regions and the glacial level\nwe descended, story by story, into the submerged part, where indeed\nwe soon saw we were in a continuous maze of connected chambers and\npassages probably leading over unlimited areas outside this particular\nbuilding.\nThe Cyclopean massiveness and giganticism of everything about us became\ncuriously oppressive; and there was something vaguely but deeply\nunhuman in all the contours, dimensions, proportions, decorations, and\nconstructional nuances of the blasphemously archaic stonework. We soon\nrealized, from what the carvings revealed, that this monstrous city was\nmany million years old.\n",
        "252": "We cannot yet explain the engineering principles used in the anomalous\nbalancing and adjustment of the vast rock masses, though the function\nof the arch was clearly much relied on. The rooms we visited were\nwholly bare of all portable contents, a circumstance which sustained\nour belief in the city's deliberate desertion. The prime decorative\nfeature was the almost universal system of mural sculpture, which\ntended to run in continuous horizontal bands three feet wide and\narranged from floor to ceiling in alternation with bands of equal width\ngiven over to geometrical arabesques.\n",
        "253": "There were exceptions to this rule of arrangement, but its\npreponderance was overwhelming. Often, however, a series of smooth\ncartouches containing oddly patterned groups of dots would be sunk\nalong one of the arabesque bands.\n       *       *       *       *       *\nThe technique, we soon saw, was mature, accomplished, and \u00e6sthetically\nevolved to the highest degree of civilized mastery, though utterly\nalien in every detail to any known art tradition of the human race.\n",
        "254": "In delicacy of execution no sculpture I have ever seen could approach\nit. The minutest details of elaborate vegetation, or of animal life,\nwere rendered with astonishing vividness despite the bold scale of the\ncarvings; whilst the conventional designs were marvels of skillful\nintricacy.\nThe arabesques displayed a profound use of mathematical principles, and\nwere made up of obscurely symmetrical curves and angles based on the\nquantity of five.\n",
        "255": "The pictorial bands followed a highly formalized tradition, and\ninvolved a peculiar treatment of perspective, but had an artistic force\nthat moved us profoundly notwithstanding the intervening gulf of vast\ngeologic periods.\nTheir method of design hinged on a singular juxtaposition of the cross\nsection with the two-dimensional silhouette, and embodied an analytical\npsychology beyond that of any known race of antiquity. It is useless to\ntry to compare this art with any represented in our museums. Those who\n",
        "256": "see our photographs will probably find its closest analogue in certain\ngrotesque conceptions of the most daring futurists.\nThe arabesque tracery consisted altogether of depressed lines, whose\ndepth on unweathered walls varied from one to two inches. When\ncartouches with dot groups appeared--evidently as inscriptions in some\nunknown and primordial language and alphabet--the depression of the\nsmooth surface was perhaps an inch and a half, and of the dots perhaps\na half inch more.

        "258": "strict conventionalization one could grasp the minute and accurate\nobservation and graphic skill of the artists; and indeed, the very\nconventions themselves served to symbolize and accentuate the real\nessence or vital differentiation of every object delineated.\nWe felt, too, that besides these recognizable excellences there\nwere others lurking beyond the reach of our perceptions. Certain\ntouches here and there gave vague hints of latent symbols and stimuli\nwhich another mental and emotional background, and a fuller or\ndifferent sensory equipment, might have made of profound and poignant\nsignificance to us.\n",
        "259": "The subject matter of the sculptures obviously came from the life of\nthe vanished epoch of their creation, and contained a large proportion\nof evident history. It is this abnormal historic-mindedness of the\nprimal race--a chance circumstance operating, through coincidence,\nmiraculously in our favor--which made the carvings so awesomely\ninformative to us, and which caused us to place their photography and\ntranscription above all other considerations.\nIn certain rooms the dominant arrangement was varied by the presence of\nmaps, astronomical charts, and other scientific designs on an enlarged\nscale--these things giving a na\u00efve and terrible corroboration to what\nwe gathered from the pictorial friezes and dados.\n",
        "260": "In hinting at what the whole revealed, I can only hope that my account\nwill not arouse a curiosity greater than sane caution on the part of\nthose who believe me at all.

        "261": "remained in place and had to be forced aside as we progressed from room\nto room.\nWindow frames with odd transparent panes--mostly elliptical--survived\nhere and there, though in no considerable quantity. There were also\nfrequent niches of great magnitude, generally empty, but once in a\nwhile containing some bizarre object carved from green soapstone which\nwas either broken or perhaps held too inferior to warrant removal.\n",
        "262": "Other apertures were undoubtedly connected with bygone mechanical\nfacilities--heating, lighting, and the like--of a sort suggested in\nmany of the carvings. Ceilings tended to be plain, but had sometimes\nbeen inlaid with green soapstone or other tiles, mostly fallen now.\nFloors were also paved with such tiles, though plain stonework\npredominated.\n",
        "263": "As I have said, all furniture and other movables were absent; but the\nsculptures gave a clear idea of the strange devices which had once\nfilled these tomblike, echoing rooms. Above the glacial sheet the\nfloors were generally thick with detritus, litter, and d\u00e9bris, but\nfarther down this condition decreased.\nIn some of the lower chambers and corridors there was little more than\ngritty dust or ancient incrustations, while occasional areas had an\nuncanny air of newly swept immaculateness.

Below the ice cap, however, the twilight deepened;\nand in many parts of the tangled ground level there was an approach to\nabsolute blackness.\n",
        "265": "To form even a rudimentary idea of our thoughts and feelings as we\npenetrated this \u00e6on-silent maze of unhuman masonry one must correlate\na hopelessly bewildering chaos of fugitive moods, memories, and\nimpressions. The sheer appalling antiquity and lethal desolation of the\nplace were enough to overwhelm almost any sensitive person, but added\nto these elements were the recent unexplained horror at the camp, and\nthe revelations all too soon effected by the terrible mural sculptures\naround us.\nThe moment we came upon a perfect section of carving, where no\nambiguity of interpretation could exist, it took only a brief study\nto give us the hideous truth--a truth which it would be na\u00efve to claim\nDanforth and I had not independently suspected before, though we had\ncarefully refrained from even hinting it to each other. There could\n",

        "276": "They seemed able to traverse the interstellar ether on their vast\nmembranous wings--thus oddly confirming some curious hill folklore long\nago told me by an antiquarian colleague. They had lived under the sea a\ngood deal, building fantastic cities and fighting terrific battles with\nnameless adversaries by means of intricate devices employing unknown\nprinciples of energy.\nEvidently their scientific and mechanical knowledge far surpassed\nman's to-day, though they made use of its more widespread and elaborate\nforms only when obliged to.\n",
        "277": "Some of the sculptures suggested that they had passed through a stage\nof mechanized life on other planets, but had receded upon finding\nits effects emotionally unsatisfying. Their preternatural toughness\nof organization and simplicity of natural wants made them peculiarly\nable to live on a high plane without the more specialized fruits\nof artificial manufacture, and even without garments, except for\noccasional protection against the elements.\nIt was under the sea, at first for food and later for other purposes,\nthat they first created earth life--using available substances\naccording to long-known methods.\n",
        "278": "The more elaborate experiments came after the annihilation of various\ncosmic enemies. They had done the same thing on other planets, having\nmanufactured not only necessary foods, but certain multicellular\nprotoplasmic masses capable of molding their tissues into all sorts of\ntemporary organs under hypnotic influence and thereby forming ideal\nslaves to perform the heavy work of the community.\nThese viscous masses were without doubt what Abdul Alhazred whispered\nabout as the \"Shoggoths\" in his frightful _Necronomicon_, though even\nthat mad Arab had not hinted that any existed on earth except in the\ndreams of those who had chewed a certain alkaloidal herb.\n",
        "279": "When the star-headed Old Ones on this planet had synthesized their\nsimple food forms and bred a good supply of Shoggoths, they allowed\nother cell groups to develop into other forms of animal and vegetable\nlife for sundry purposes, extirpating any whose presence became\ntroublesome.\nWith the aid of the Shoggoths, whose expansions could be made to lift\nprodigious weights, the small, low cities under the sea grew to vast\nand imposing labyrinths of stone not unlike those which later rose on\nland. Indeed, the highly adaptable Old Ones had lived much on land in\nother parts of the universe, and probably retained many traditions of\nland construction.\n",

The tops of the buildings,\nwhich in the actual city around us had, of course, been weathered into\nshapeless ruins ages ago, were clearly displayed in the bas-reliefs,\nand showed vast clusters of needlelike spires, delicate finials\non certain cone and pyramid apexes, and tiers of thin, horizontal\nscalloped disks capping cylindrical shafts.\nThis was exactly what we had seen in that monstrous and portentous\nmirage, cast by a dead city whence such sky-line features had been\nabsent for thousands and ten of thousands of years, which loomed on our\nignorant eyes across the unfathomed mountains of madness as we first\napproached poor Lake's ill-fated camp.\n",

Another race--a land race of beings\nshaped like octopi and probably corresponding to the fabulous prehuman\nspawn of Cthulhu--soon began filtering down from cosmic infinity and\nprecipitated a monstrous war which for a time drove the Old Ones\nwholly back to the sea--a colossal blow in view of the increasing land\nsettlements.\n",
        "298": "Later, peace was made, and the new lands were given to the Cthulhu\nspawn whilst the Old Ones held the sea and the older lands. New land\ncities were founded--the greatest of them in the antarctic, for this\nregion of first arrival was sacred.\nFrom then on, as before, the antarctic remained the center of the Old\nOnes' civilization, and all the cities built there by the Cthulhu spawn\nwere blotted out.\n",

On\nland the great reptiles proved highly tractable; but the Shoggoths of\nthe sea, reproducing by fission and acquiring a dangerous degree of\naccidental intelligence, presented for a time a formidable problem.\n",
        "301": "They had always been controlled through the hypnotic suggestion of\nthe Old Ones, and had modeled their tough plasticity into various\nuseful temporary limbs and organs; but now their self-modeling powers\nwere sometimes exercised independently, and in various imitative\nforms implanted by past suggestion. They had, it seems, developed a\nsemistable brain whose separate and occasionally stubborn volition\nechoed the will of the Old Ones without always obeying it.\nSculptured images of these Shoggoths filled Danforth and me with\nhorror and loathing. They were normally shapeless entities composed\n",

        "304": "Though during the rebellion the Shoggoths had shown an ability to\nlive out of water, this transition was not encouraged--since their\nusefulness on land would hardly have been commensurate with the trouble\nof their management.\nDuring the Jurassic Age the Old Ones met fresh adversity in the\nform of a new invasion from outer space--this time by half-fungous,\nhalf-crustacean creatures--creatures undoubtedly the same as those\nfiguring in certain whispered hill legends of the north, and remembered\nin the Himalayas as the Mi-Go, or Abominable Snow Men.\nTo fight these beings the Old Ones attempted, for the first time\nsince their terrene advent, to sally forth again into the planetary\nether; but, despite all traditional preparations, found it no longer\npossible to leave the earth's atmosphere.

They were able to undergo transformations and reintegrations\nimpossible for their adversaries, and seem therefore to have originally\ncome from even remoter gulfs of cosmic space.\nThe Old Ones, but for their abnormal toughness and peculiar vital\nproperties, were strictly material, and must have had their absolute\norigin within the known space-time continuum--whereas the first\nsources of the other beings can only be guessed at with bated breath.\n",
        "307": "All this, of course, assuming that the nonterrestrial linkages and\nthe anomalies ascribed to the invading foes are not pure mythology.\nConceivably, the Old Ones might have invented a cosmic framework\nto account for their occasional defeats, since historical interest\nand pride obviously formed their chief psychological element. It is\nsignificant that their annals failed to mention many advanced and\npotent races of beings whose mighty cultures and towering ethics figure\npersistently in certain obscure legends.\n",
        "308": "The changing state of the world through long geologic ages appeared\nwith startling vividness in many of the sculptured maps and scenes. In\ncertain cases existing science will require revision, while in other\ncases its bold deductions are magnificently confirmed.\nAs I have said, the hypothesis of Taylor, Wegener, and Joly that all\nthe continents are fragments of an original antarctic land mass which\ncracked from centrifugal force and drifted apart over a technically\nviscous lower surface--an hypothesis suggested by such things as the\ncomplimentary outlines of Africa and South America, and the way the\ngreat mountain chains are rolled and shoved up--receives striking\nsupport from this uncanny source.\n",
        "309": "Maps evidently showing the Carboniferous of a hundred million or\nmore years ago displayed significant rifts and chasms destined later\nto separate Africa from the once continuous realms of Europe (then\nthe Valusia of primal legend), Asia, the Americas, and the antarctic\ncontinent.\nOther charts--and most significantly one in connection with the\nfounding fifty million years ago of the vast dead city around\nus--showed all the present continents well differentiated. And in\nthe latest discoverable specimen--dating perhaps from the Pliocene\nAge--the approximate world of to-day appeared quite clearly despite the\nlinkage of Alaska with Siberia, of North America with Europe through\nGreenland, and of South America with the antarctic continent through\nGraham Land.\n",
        "310": "In the Carboniferous map the whole globe--ocean floor and rifted land\nmass alike--bore symbols of the Old Ones' vast stone cities, but in the\nlater charts the gradual recession toward the antarctic became very\nplain.\nThe final Pliocene specimen showed no land cities except on the\nantarctic continent and the tip of South America, nor any ocean\ncities north of the fiftieth parallel of South Latitude. Knowledge\nand interest in the northern world, save for a study of coast lines\nprobably made during long exploration flights on those fan-like\nmembranous wings, had evidently declined to zero among the Old Ones.\n",
        "311": "Destruction of cities through the up-thrust of mountains, the\ncentrifugal rending of continents, the seismic convulsions of land or\nsea bottom, and other natural causes was a matter of common record; and\nit was curious to observe how fewer and fewer replacements were made as\nthe ages wore on.\nThe vast dead megalopolis that yawned around us seemed to be the last\ngeneral center of the race--built early in the Cretaceous Age after a\ntitanic earth buckling had obliterated a still vaster predecessor not\nfar distant.\nIt appeared that this general region was the most sacred spot of\nall, where reputedly the first Old Ones had settled on a primal sea\nbottom.

This was the\nlast place we examined in detail, since what we found there set upon us\na fresh, immediate objective.\n",

        "315": "The great mountain chain was tremendously long--starting as a low range\nat Luitpold Land on the coast of Weddell Sea and virtually crossing the\nentire continent. The really high part stretched in a mighty arc from\nabout Latitude 82\u00b0, E. Longitude 60\u00b0 to Latitude 70\u00b0, East Longitude\n115\u00b0, with its concave side toward our camp and its seaward end in the\nregion of that long, ice-locked coast whose hills were glimpsed by\nWilkes and Mawson at the antarctic circle.\n",

I have said that these peaks are higher than the\nHimalayas, but the sculptures forbid me to say that they are earth's\nhighest.

        "317": "It seems that there was one part of the ancient land--the first part\nthat ever rose from the waters after the earth had flung off the moon\nand the Old Ones had seeped down from the stars--which had come to be\nshunned as vaguely and namelessly evil. Cities built there had crumbled\nbefore their time, and had been found suddenly deserted.\nThen when the first great earth buckling had convulsed the region in\nthe Comanchean Age, a frightful line of peaks had shot suddenly up\namidst the most appalling din and chaos--and earth had received her\nloftiest and most terrible mountains.\n",

        "322": "In the course of ages the caves had appeared, and had been shaped into\nadjuncts of the temples. With the advance of still later epochs all\nthe limestone veins of the region were hollowed out by ground waters,\nso that the mountains, the foothills, and the plains below them were\na veritable network of connected caverns and galleries.

Little by little it had eaten away the\nlimestone hill base at its turning, till at last its sapping currents\nreached the caverns of the ground waters and joined with them in\ndigging a deeper abyss.\nFinally its whole bulk emptied into the hollow hills and left the old\nbed toward the ocean dry.

        "325": "Its position in different carvings of the city helped us to orient\nourselves to the scene as it had been at various stages of the region's\nage-long, \u00e6on-dead history, so that we were able to sketch a hasty but\ncareful map of the salient features--squares, important buildings, and\nthe like--for guidance in further explorations.\nWe could soon reconstruct in fancy the whole stupendous thing as it was\na million or ten million or fifty million years ago, for the sculptures\ntold us exactly what the buildings and mountains and squares and\nsuburbs and landscape setting and luxuriant Tertiary vegetation had\nlooked like.\nIt must have had a marvelous and mystic beauty, and as I thought of\nit I almost forgot the clammy sense of sinister oppression with which\nthe city's inhuman age and massiveness and deadness and remoteness and\nglacial twilight had choked and weighed on my spirit.\n",
        "326": "Yet, according to certain carvings the denizens of that city had\nthemselves known the clutch of oppressive terror; for there was a\nsomber and recurrent type of scene in which the Old Ones were shown in\nthe act of recoiling affrightedly from some object--never allowed to\nappear in the design--found in the great river and indicated as having\nbeen washed down through waving, vine-draped cycad forests from those\nhorrible westward mountains.\nIt was only in the one late-built house with the decadent carvings that\nwe obtained any foreshadowing of the final calamity leading to the\ncity's desertion.

The ultimate blow, of course,\n",

This was partly due, no doubt, to the\ntraditional sacredness of this special region, but may have been more\nconclusively determined by the opportunities it gave for continuing\nthe use of the great temples on the honeycombed mountains, and for\nretaining the vast land city as a place of summer residence and base of\ncommunication with various mines.\n",

        "336": "Art and decoration were pursued, though, of course, with a certain\ndecadence. The Old Ones seemed to realize this falling off themselves,\nand in many cases anticipated the policy of Constantine the Great by\ntransplanting especially fine blocks of ancient carving from their\nland city, just as the emperor, in a similar age of decline, stripped\nGreece and Asia of their finest art to give his new Byzantine capital\ngreater splendors than its own people could create. That the transfer\nof sculptured blocks had not been more extensive, was doubtless owing\nto the fact that the land city was not at first wholly abandoned.\n",
        "337": "By the time total abandonment did occur--and it surely must have\noccurred before the polar Pleistocene was far advanced--the Old Ones\nhad perhaps become satisfied with their decadent art--or had ceased\nto recognize the superior merit of the older carvings. At any rate,\nthe \u00e6on-silent ruins around us had certainly undergone no wholesale\nsculptural denudation, though all the best separate statues, like other\nmovables, had been taken away.\nThe decadent cartouches and dados telling this story were, as I have\nsaid, the latest we could find in our limited search. They left us with\n",

Vegetation was declining, and the terrible snows of the\nwinter no longer melted completely even in midsummer.\n",

To keep on with the work of the upper\nworld it had become necessary to adapt some of the amorphous and\ncuriously cold-resistant Shoggoths to land life--a thing the Old Ones\nhad formerly been reluctant to do.

To behold this\nfabulous gulf in stark reality was a lure which seemed impossible of\nresistance once we knew of the thing--yet we realized we must begin the\nquest at once if we expected to include it in our present trip.\n",

As\nwe looked more steadily, we saw that beyond a doubt there had been a\nslight and recent clearing away of d\u00e9bris from that particular opening.\nWhatever the lurking horror might be, we believed the direct avenue\ntoward it was now plainly manifest.

We had found\ncertain inexplicably blotted papers at the camp which might have\nprepared us, yet the effect of the sight, down there in the prehuman\nvaults of a nightmare city, was almost too much to bear.\n",

But what this art-blind bungler could\nnever have done was to execute those sketches in a strange and assured\ntechnique perhaps superior, despite haste and carelessness, to any of\nthe decadent carvings from which they were taken--the characteristic\nand unmistakable technique of the Old Ones themselves in the dead\ncity's heyday.\n",

        "388": "Seeking its source, we entered an archway from which much d\u00e9bris had\nbeen cleared; resuming our trail blazing--with an added paper supply\ntaken with curious repugnance from one of the tarpaulin bundles on the\nsledges--when we left daylight behind.\nAs the glaciated floor gave place to a litter of detritus, we plainly\ndiscerned some curious, dragging tracks; and once Danforth found\na distinct print of a sort whose description would be only too\nsuperfluous. The course indicated by the penguin cries was precisely\nwhat our map and compass prescribed as an approach to the more\nnortherly tunnel mouth, and we were glad to find that a bridgeless\nthoroughfare on the ground and basement levels seemed open.\n",
        "389": "The tunnel, according to the chart, ought to start from the basement of\na large pyramidal structure which we seemed vaguely to recall from our\na\u00ebrial survey as remarkably well-preserved. Along our path the single\ntorch showed a customary profusion of carvings, but we did not pause to\nexamine any of these.\n       *       *       *       *       *\nSuddenly a bulky white shape loomed up ahead of us, and we flashed on\nthe second torch. It is odd how wholly this new quest had turned our\n",
        "390": "minds from earlier fears of what might lurk near. Those other ones,\nhaving left their supplies in the great circular place, must have\nplanned to return after their scouting trip toward or into the abyss;\nyet we had now discarded all caution concerning them as completely as\nif they had never existed.\nThis white, waddling thing was fully six feet high, yet we seemed to\nrealize at once that it was not one of those others. They were larger\n",
        "391": "and dark, and, according to the sculptures, their motion over land\nsurfaces was a swift, assured matter despite the queerness of their\nsea-born tentacle equipment. But to say that the white thing did not\nprofoundly frighten us would be vain. We were indeed clutched for an\ninstant by a primitive dread almost sharper than the worst of our\nreasoned fears regarding those others.\n",
        "392": "Then came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a\nlateral archway to our left, to join two others of its kind which\nhad summoned it in raucous tones. For it was only a penguin--albeit\nof a huge, unknown species larger than the greatest of the known\nking penguins, and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual\neyelessness.\nWhen we had followed the thing into the archway and turned both our\ntorches on the indifferent and unheeding group of three, we saw that\nthey were all eyeless albinos of the same unknown and gigantic species.\n",
        "393": "Their size reminded us of some of the archaic penguins depicted in the\nOld Ones' sculptures, and it did not take us long to conclude that\nthey were descended from the same stock--undoubtedly surviving through\na retreat to some warmer inner region whose perpetual blackness had\ndestroyed their pigmentation and atrophied their eyes to mere useless\nslits.\nThat their present habitat was the vast abyss we sought, was not for a\nmoment to be doubted; and this evidence of the gulf's continued warmth\nand habitability filled us with the most curious and subtly perturbing\nfancies.\nWe wondered, too, what had caused these three birds to venture out\nof their usual domain. The state and silence of the great dead city\n",
        "394": "made it clear that it had at no time been a habitual seasonal rookery,\nwhilst the manifest indifference of the trio to our presence made it\nseem odd that any passing party of those others should have startled\nthem.\nWas it possible that those others had taken some aggressive notion or\ntried to increase their meat supply? We doubted whether that pungent\nodor which the dogs had hated could cause an equal antipathy in these\npenguins; since their ancestors had obviously lived on excellent terms\nwith the Old Ones--an amicable relationship which must have survived in\nthe abyss below as long as any of the Old Ones remained.\n",
        "395": "Regretting--in a flare-up of the old spirit of pure science--that we\ncould not photograph these anomalous creatures, we shortly left them\nto their squawking and pushed on toward the abyss whose openness was\nnow so positively proved to us, and whose exact direction occasional\npenguin tracks made clear.\n       *       *       *       *       *\nNot long afterward a steep descent in a long, low, doorless, and\npeculiarly sculptureless corridor led us to believe that we were\napproaching the tunnel mouth at last. We had passed two more penguins.\nThen the corridor ended in a prodigious open space which made us\ngasp involuntarily--a perfect inverted hemisphere, obviously deep\nunderground, fully a hundred feet in diameter and fifty feet high, with\nlow archways opening around all parts of the circumference but one, and\nthat one yawning cavernously with a black, arched aperture which broke\nthe symmetry of the vault to a height of nearly fifteen feet. It was\n",
        "396": "the entrance to the great abyss.\nIn this vast hemisphere, whose concave roof was impressively though\ndecadently carved to a likeness of the primordial celestial dome, a few\nalbino penguins waddled--aliens there, but indifferent and unseeing.\nThe black tunnel yawned indefinitely off at a steep, descending grade,\nits aperture adorned with grotesquely chiseled jambs and lintel.\n",
        "397": "From that cryptical mouth we fancied a current of slightly warmer air\nand perhaps even a suspicion of vapor proceeded; and we wondered what\nliving entities other than penguins the limitless void below, and the\ncontiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains, might\nconceal.\nWe wondered, too, whether the trace of mountaintop smoke at first\nsuspected by poor Lake, as well as the odd haze we had ourselves\nperceived around the rampart-crowned peak, might not be caused by\nthe tortuous-channeled rising of some such vapor from the unfathomed\nregions of earth's core.\nEntering the tunnel, we saw that its outline was--at least at the\nstart--about fifteen feet each way--sides, floor, and arched roof\ncomposed of the usual megalithic masonry. The sides were sparsely\n",
        "398": "decorated with cartouches of conventional designs in a later, decadent\nstyle; and all the construction and carving were marvellously\nwell-preserved.\nThe floor was quite clear, except for a slight detritus bearing\noutgoing penguin tracks and the inward tracks of those others. The\nfarther one advanced, the warmer it became; so that we were soon\nunbuttoning our heavy garments. We wondered whether there were any\n",
        "399": "actually igneous manifestations below, and whether the waters of that\nsunless sea were hot.\nAfter a short distance the masonry gave place to solid rock, though\nthe tunnel kept the same proportions and presented the same aspect of\ncarved regularity. Occasionally its varying grade became so steep that\ngrooves were cut in the floor.\n",
        "400": "Several times we noted the mouths of small lateral galleries not\nrecorded in our diagrams; none of them such as to complicate the\nproblem of our return, and all of them welcome as possible refuges in\ncase we met unwelcome entities on their way back from the abyss.\nThe nameless scent of such things was very distinct. Doubtless it\nwas suicidally foolish to venture into that tunnel under the known\nconditions, but the lure of the unplumbed is stronger in certain\npersons than most suspect--indeed, it was just such a lure which had\nbrought us to this unearthly polar waste in the first place.\n",
        "401": "We saw several penguins as we passed along, and speculated on the\ndistance we would have to traverse. The carvings had led us to expect\na steep downhill walk of about a mile to the abyss, but our previous\nwanderings had shown us that matters of scale were not wholly to be\ndepended on.\nAfter about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly\naccentuated, and we kept very careful track of the various lateral\nopenings we passed. There was no visible vapor as at the mouth, but\n",
        "402": "this was doubtless due to the lack of contrasting cooler air. The\ntemperature was rapidly ascending, and we were not surprised to come\nupon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us. It was\ncomposed of furs and tent cloths taken from Lake's camp, and we did\nnot pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been\nslashed.\n",
        "403": "Slightly beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size\nand number of the side galleries, and concluded that the densely\nhoneycombed region beneath the higher foothills must now have been\nreached.\nThe nameless scent was now curiously mixed with another and scarcely\nless offensive odor--of what nature we could not guess, though we\nthought of decaying organisms and perhaps unknown subterrane fungi.\nThen came a startling expansion of the tunnel for which the\ncarvings had not prepared us--a broadening and rising into a lofty,\nnatural-looking elliptical cavern with a level floor, some seventy-five\nfeet long and fifty broad, and with many immense side passages leading\naway into cryptical darkness.\n",
        "404": "       *       *       *       *       *\nThough this cavern was natural in appearance, an inspection with both\ntorches suggested that it had been formed by the artificial destruction\nof several walls between adjacent honeycombings. The walls were\nrough, and the high, vaulted roof was thick with stalactites; but the\nsolid rock floor had been smoothed off, and was free from all d\u00e9bris,\ndetritus, or even dust to a positively abnormal extent.\nExcept for the avenue through which we had come, this was true of\nthe floors of all the great galleries opening off from it; and the\nsingularity of the condition was such as to set us vainly puzzling.\n",
        "405": "The curious new fetor which had supplemented the nameless scent was\nexcessively pungent here; so much so that it destroyed all trace of the\nother. Something about this whole place, with its polished and almost\nglistening floor, struck us as more vaguely baffling and horrible than\nany of the monstrous things we have previously encountered.\nThe regularity of the passage immediately ahead, prevented all\nconfusion as to the right course amidst this plethora of equally great\ncave mouths. Nevertheless we resolved to resume our paper trail blazing\n",
        "406": "if any further complexity should develop; for dust tracks, of course,\ncould no longer be expected.\nUpon resuming our direct progress we cast a beam of torchlight over the\ntunnel walls--and stopped short in amazement at the supremely radical\nchange which had come over the carvings in this part of the passage.\nWe realized, of course, the great decadence of the Old Ones' sculpture\nat the time of the tunneling, and had indeed noticed the inferior\nworkmanship of the arabesques in the stretches behind us.\n",
        "407": "But now, in this deeper section beyond the cavern, there was a sudden\ndifference wholly transcending explanation--a difference in basic\nnature as well as in mere quality, and involving so profound and\ncalamitous a degradation of skill that nothing in the hitherto observed\nrate of decline could have led one to expect it.\nThis new and degenerate work was coarse, bold, and wholly lacking in\ndelicacy of detail. It was countersunk with exaggerated depth in bands\nfollowing the same general line as the sparse cartouches of the earlier\nsections, but the height of the reliefs did not reach the level of the\ngeneral surface.\n",
        "408": "Danforth had the idea that it was a second carving--a sort of\npalimpsest formed after the obliteration of a previous design. In\nnature it was wholly decorative and conventional, and consisted of\ncrude spirals and angles roughly following the quintile mathematical\ntradition of the Old Ones, yet seeming more like a parody than a\nperpetuation of that tradition.\nSince we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study, we\nresumed our advance after a cursory look.\n",
        "409": "We saw and heard fewer penguins, but thought we caught a vague\nsuspicion of an infinitely distant chorus of them somewhere deep within\nthe earth. The new and inexplicable odor was abominably strong, and we\ncould detect scarcely a sign of that other nameless scent.\nPuffs of visible vapor ahead bespoke increasing contrasts in\ntemperature, and the relative nearness of the sunless sea cliffs of the\ngreat abyss. Then, quite unexpectedly, we saw certain obstructions on\n",
        "410": "the polished floor ahead--obstructions which were quite definitely not\npenguins--and turned on our second torch after making sure that the\nobjects were quite stationary.\n                                  XI.\nStill another time have I come to a place where it is very difficult\nto proceed. I ought to be hardened by this stage; but there are some\n",
        "411": "experiences and intimations which scar too deeply to permit of healing,\nand leave only such added sensitiveness that memory re-inspired all the\noriginal horror.\nWe saw, as I have said, certain obstructions on the polished\nfloor ahead; and I may add that our nostrils were assailed almost\nsimultaneously by a very curious intensification of the strange,\nprevailing fetor, now quite plainly mixed with the nameless stench of\nthose others which had gone before us.\nThe light of the second torch left no doubt of what the obstructions\nwere, and we dared approach them only because we could see, even from\na distance, that they were quite as past all harming power as had been\nthe six similar specimens unearthed from the monstrous star-mounded\ngraves at poor Lake's camp.\n",
        "412": "They were, indeed, as lacking in completeness as most of those we\nhad unearthed--though it grew plain from the thick, dark-green pool\ngathering around them that their incompleteness was of infinitely\ngreater recency. There seemed to be only four of them, whereas Lake's\nbulletins would have suggested no less than eight as forming the\ngroup which had preceded us. To find them in this state was wholly\nunexpected, and we wondered what sort of monstrous struggle had\noccurred down here in the dark.\n",
        "413": "Penguins, attacked in a body, retaliate savagely with their beaks; and\nour ears now made certain the existence of a rookery far beyond. Had\nthose others disturbed such a place and aroused murderous pursuit? The\nobstructions did not suggest it, for penguin beaks against the tough\ntissues Lake had dissected could hardly account for the terrible damage\nour approaching glance was beginning to make out. Besides, the huge\n",
        "414": "blind birds we had seen appeared to be singularly peaceful.\nHad there, then, been a struggle among those others, and were the\nabsent four responsible? If so, where were they? Were they close at\nhand and likely to form an immediate menace to us? We glanced anxiously\n",
        "415": "at some of the smooth-floored lateral passages as we continued our slow\nand frankly reluctant approach.\nWhatever the conflict was, it had clearly been that which had\nfrightened the penguins into their unaccustomed wandering. It must,\nthen, have arisen near that faintly heard rookery in the incalculable\ngulf beyond, since there were no signs that any birds had normally\ndwelt here.\n",
        "416": "Perhaps, we reflected, there had been a hideous running fight, with\nthe weaker party seeking to get back to the cached sledges when their\npursuers finished them. One could picture the demonic fray between\nnamelessly monstrous entities as it surged out of the black abyss with\ngreat clouds of frantic penguins squawking and scurrying ahead.\nI say that we approached those sprawling and incomplete obstructions\nslowly and reluctantly. Would to Heaven we had never approached them at\n",
        "417": "all, but had run back at top speed out of that blasphemous tunnel with\nthe greasily smooth floors and the degenerate murals aping and mocking\nthe things they had superseded--run back, before we had seen what we\ndid see, and before our minds were burned with something which will\nnever let us breathe easily again!\n       *       *       *       *       *\nBoth of our torches were turned on the prostrate objects, so that we\nsoon realized the dominant factor in their incompleteness. Mauled,\ncompressed, twisted, and ruptured as they were, their chief common\ninjury was total decapitation.\n",
        "418": "From each one the tentacled starfish head had been removed; and as\nwe drew near we saw that the manner of removal looked more like some\nhellish tearing or suction than like any ordinary form of cleavage.\nTheir noisome dark-green ichor formed a large, spreading pool; but its\nstench was half overshadowed by that newer and stranger stench, here\nmore pungent than at any other point along our route.\nOnly when we had come very close to the sprawling obstructions could we\ntrace that second, unexplainable fetor to any immediate source--and the\ninstant we did so Danforth, remembering certain very vivid sculptures\nof the Old Ones' history in the Permian Age one hundred and fifty\nmillion years ago, gave vent to a nerve-tortured cry which echoed\nhysterically through that vaulted and archaic passage with the evil,\npalimpsest carvings.\n",
        "419": "I came only just short of echoing his cry myself; for I had seen those\nprimal sculptures, too, and had shudderingly admired the way the\nnameless artist had suggested that hideous slime coating found on\ncertain incomplete and prostrate Old Ones--those whom the frightful\nShoggoths had characteristically slain and sucked to a ghastly\nheadlessness in the great war of resubjugation.\nThey were infamous, nightmare sculptures even when telling of age-old,\nbygone things; for Shoggoths and their work ought not to be seen by\nhuman beings or portrayed by any beings.\nThe mad author of the _Necronomicon_ had nervously tried to swear that\nnone had been bred on this planet, and that only drugged dreamers\nhad ever conceived them. Formless protoplasm able to mock and\n",
        "420": "reflect all forms and organs and processes--viscous agglutinations\nof bubbling cells--rubbery fifteen-foot spheroids infinitely plastic\nand ductile--slaves of suggestion, builders of cities--more and more\nsullen, more and more intelligent, more and more amphibious, more and\nmore imitative! Great Heaven! What madness made even those blasphemous\nOld Ones willing to use and to carve such things?\nAnd now, when Danforth and I saw the freshly glistening and\nreflectively iridescent black slime which clung thickly to those\nheadless bodies and stank obscenely with that new, unknown odor whose\ncause only a diseased fancy could envisage--clung to those bodies\nand sparkled less voluminously on a smooth part of the accursedly\nresculptured wall in a series of grouped dots--we understood the\nquality of cosmic fear to its uttermost depths.\n",
        "421": "It was not fear of those four missing others--for all too well did we\nsuspect they would do no harm again. Poor devils! After all, they were\nnot evil things of their kind. They were the men of another age and\nanother order of being. Nature had played a hellish jest on them--as\n",
        "422": "it will on any others that human madness, callousness, or cruelty may\nhereafter drag up in that hideously dead or sleeping polar waste--and\nthis was their tragic homecoming.\nThey had not been even savages--for what indeed had they done? That\nawful awakening in the cold of an unknown epoch--perhaps an attack by\nthe furry, frantically barking quadrupeds, and a dazed defense against\nthem and the equally frantic white simians with the queer wrappings and\nparaphernalia! Poor Lake. Poor Gedney. And poor Old Ones! Scientists\n",
        "423": "to the last--what had they done that we would not have done in their\nplace? Lord, what intelligence and persistence! What a facing of the\nincredible, just as those carven kinsmen and forbears had faced things\nonly a little less incredible! Radiates, vegetables, monstrosities,\nstar spawn--whatever they had been, they were men!\n",

They had found their dead\ncity brooding under its curse, and had read its carven latter days as\nwe had done. They had tried to reach their living fellows in fabled\ndepths of blackness they had never seen--and what had they found?\n",
        "425": "All this flashed in unison through the thoughts of Danforth and me as\nwe looked from those headless, slime-coated shapes to the loathsome\npalimpsest sculptures and the diabolical dot groups of fresh slime on\nthe wall beside them--looked and understood what must have triumphed\nand survived down there in the Cyclopean water city of that nighted,\npenguin-fringed abyss, whence even now a sinister curling mist had\nbegun to belch pallidly as if in answer to Danforth's hysterical scream.\nThe shock of recognizing that monstrous slime and headlessness had\nfrozen us into mute, motionless statues, and it is only through later\nconversations that we have learned of the complete identity of our\nthoughts at that moment.\nIt seemed \u00e6ons that we stood there, but actually it could not have been\nmore than ten or fifteen seconds. That hateful, pallid mist curled\n",
        "426": "forward as if veritably driven by some remoter advancing bulk--and then\ncame a sound which upset much of what we had just decided, and in so\ndoing broke the spell and enabled us to run like mad past squawking,\nconfused penguins over our former trail back to the city, along\nice-sunken megalithic corridors to the great open circle, and up that\narchaic spiral ramp in a frenzied, automatic plunge for the sane outer\nair and light of day.\n[Illustration: _And then came a sound--a horrible sound--which enabled\nus to run like mad for the sane outer air_----]\nThe new sound, as I have intimated, upset much that we had decided;\nbecause it was what poor Lake's dissection had led us to attribute\nto those we had just judged dead. It was, Danforth later told me,\nprecisely what he had caught in infinitely muffled form when at that\nspot beyond the alley corner above the glacial level; and it certainly\nhad a shocking resemblance to the wind pipings we had both heard around\nthe lofty mountain caves.\n",
        "427": "At the risk of seeming puerile I will add another thing, too, if\nonly because of the surprising way Danforth's impression chimed with\nmine. Of course, common reading is what prepared us both to make the\ninterpretation, though Danforth has hinted at queer notions about\nunsuspected and forbidden sources to which Poe may have had access when\nwriting his \"Arthur Gordon Pym\" a century ago.\nIt will be remembered that in that fantastic tale there is a word of\nunknown but terrible and prodigious significance connected with the\nantarctic and screamed eternally by the gigantic, spectrally snowy\nbirds of that malign region's core. \"_Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!_\" That, I\n",
        "428": "may admit, is exactly what we thought we heard conveyed by that sudden\nsound behind the advancing white mist--that insidious, musical piping\nover a singularly wide range.\n       *       *       *       *       *\nWe were in full flight before three notes or syllables had been\nuttered, though we knew that the swiftness of the Old Ones would enable\nany scream-roused and pursuing survivor of the slaughter to overtake us\nin a moment if it really wished to do so.\nWe had a vague hope, however, that nonaggressive conduct and a display\nof kindred reason might cause such a being to spare us in case of\ncapture, if only from scientific curiosity.\n",
        "429": "After all, if such a one had nothing to fear for itself it would have\nno motive in harming us. Concealment being futile at this juncture, we\nused our torch for a running glance behind, and perceived that the mist\nwas thinning. Would we see at last, a complete and living specimen of\nthose others? Again came that insidious musical piping--\"_Tekeli-li!\n",
        "430": "Tekeli-li!_\"\nThen, noting that we were actually gaining on our pursuer, it occurred\nto us that the entity might be wounded.

        "431": "timing was too close to admit of doubt.\nOf the whereabouts of that less conceivable and less mentionable\nnightmare--that fetid, unglimpsed mountain of slime-spewing protoplasm\nwhose race had conquered the abyss and sent land pioneers to recarve\nand squirm through the burrows of the hills--we could form no guess;\nand it cost us a genuine pang to leave this probably crippled Old\nOne--perhaps a lone survivor--to the peril of recapture and a nameless\nfate.\nThank Heaven we did not slacken our run. The curling mist had thickened\n",
        "432": "again, and was driving ahead with increased speed; whilst the straying\npenguins in our rear were squawking and screaming and displaying\nsigns of a panic really surprising in view of their relatively minor\nconfusion when we had passed them.\nOnce more came that sinister, wide-ranged piping--\"_Tekeli-li!\nTekeli-li!_\" We had been wrong.

        "433": "merely paused on encountering the bodies of its fallen kindred and the\nhellish slime inscription above them. We could never know what that\ndemon message was--but those burials at Lake's camp had shown how much\nimportance the beings attached to their dead.\nOur recklessly used torch now revealed ahead of us the large open\ncavern where various ways converged, and we were glad to be leaving\nthose morbid palimpsest sculptures--almost felt even when scarcely\nseen--behind.\n",
        "434": "Another thought which the advent of the cave inspired was the\npossibility of losing our pursuer at this bewildering focus of large\ngalleries. There were several of the blind albino penguins in the open\nspace, and it seemed clear that their fear of the oncoming entity was\nextreme to the point of unaccountability.\nIf at that point we dimmed our torch to the very lowest limit of\ntraveling need, keeping it strictly in front of us, the frightened\nsquawking motions of the huge birds in the mist might muffle our\nfootfalls, screen our true course, and somehow set up a false lead.\n",
        "435": "Amidst the churning, spiraling fog, the littered and unglistening floor\nof the main tunnel beyond this point, as differing from the other\nmorbidly polished burrows, could hardly form a highly distinguishing\nfeature; even, so far as we could conjecture, for those indicated\nspecial senses which made the Old Ones partly, though imperfectly,\nindependent of light in emergencies.\nIn fact, we were somewhat apprehensive lest we go astray ourselves\nin our haste. For we had, of course, decided to keep straight on\ntoward the dead city; since the consequences of loss in those unknown\nfoothill honeycombings would be unthinkable.\n",
        "436": "The fact that we survived and emerged is sufficient proof that the\nthing did take a wrong gallery whilst we providentially hit on\nthe right one. The penguins alone could not have saved us, but in\nconjunction with the mist they seem to have done so. Only a benign fate\nkept the curling vapors thick enough at the right moment, for they were\nconstantly shifting and threatening to vanish.\n",
        "437": "Indeed, they did lift for a second just before we emerged from the\nnauseously resculptured tunnel into the cave; so that we actually\ncaught one first and only half glimpse of the oncoming entity as we\ncast a final, desperately fearful glance backward before dimming the\ntorch and mixing with the penguins in the hope of dodging pursuit. If\nthe fate which screened us was benign, that which gave us the half\nglimpse was infinitely the opposite; for to that flash of semivision\ncan be traced a full half of the horror which has ever since haunted us.\n       *       *       *       *       *\nOur exact motive in looking back again was perhaps no more than the\nimmemorial instinct of the pursued to gauge the nature and course\nof its pursuer; or perhaps it was an automatic attempt to answer a\nsubconscious question raised by one of our senses.\n",
        "438": "In the midst of our flight, with all our faculties centered on the\nproblem of escape, we were in no condition to observe and analyze\ndetails; yet even so our latent brain cells must have wondered at the\nmessage brought them by our nostrils. Afterward, we realized what it\nwas--that our retreat from the fetid slime coating on those headless\nobstructions, and the coincident approach of the pursuing entity, had\nnot brought us the exchange of stenches which logic called for.\nIn the neighborhood of the prostrate things that new and lately\nunexplainable fetor had been wholly dominant; but by this time it ought\nto have largely given place to the nameless stench associated with\nthose others. This it had not done--for instead, the newer and less\n",
        "439": "bearable smell was now virtually undiluted, and growing more and more\npoisonously insistent each second.\nSo we glanced back--simultaneously, it would appear; though no doubt\nthe incipient motion of one prompted the imitation of the other. As\nwe did so we flashed both torches full strength at the momentarily\nthinned mist; either from sheer primitive anxiety to see all we could,\nor in a less primitive but equally unconscious effort to dazzle the\nentity before we dimmed our light and dodged among the penguins of the\nlabyrinth center ahead.\n",
        "440": "Unhappy act! Not Orpheus himself, or Lot's wife, paid much more dearly\nfor a backward glance. And again came that shocking, wide-ranged\npiping--\"_Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!_\"\n",

It had only\nhorror, because I knew unerringly the monstrous, nefandous analogy that\nhad suggested it.\n",
        "443": "We had expected, upon looking back, to see a terrible and incredible\nmoving entity if the mists were thin enough; but of that entity we had\nformed a clear idea. What we did see--for the mists were indeed all too\nmalignly thinned--was something altogether different, and immeasurably\nmore hideous and detestable. It was the utter, objective embodiment of\nthe fantastic novelist's 'thing that should not be'; and its nearest\ncomprehensible analogue is a vast, onrushing subway train as one sees\nit from a station platform--the great black front looming colossally\nout of infinite subterraneous distance, constellated with strangely\ncolored lights and filling the prodigious burrow.\n",
        "444": "But we were not on a station platform. We were on the track ahead as\nthe nightmare, plastic column of fetid black iridescence oozed tightly\nonward through its fifteen-foot sinus, gathering unholy speed and\ndriving before it a spiral, rethickening cloud of the pallid abyss\nvapor.\nIt was a terrible, indescribable thing, vaster than any subway train--a\nshapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and\nwith myriads of temporary eyes forming and unforming as pustules of\ngreenish light all over the tunnel-filling front that bore down upon\nus, crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening\nfloor that it and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter.\n",
        "445": "Still came that eldritch, mocking cry--\"_Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!_\" And at\nlast we remembered that the demonic Shoggoths--given life, though, and\nplastic organ patterns solely by the Old Ones, and having no language\nsave that which the dot groups expressed--had likewise no voice save\nthe imitated accents of their bygone masters.\n                                 XII.\n",
        "446": "Danforth and I have recollections of emerging into the great sculptured\nhemisphere and of threading our back trail through the Cyclopean rooms\nand corridors of the dead city; yet these are purely dream fragments\ninvolving no memory of volition, details, or physical exertion.\nThere was something vaguely appropriate about our departure from those\nburied epochs; for as we wound our panting way up the sixty-foot\ncylinder of primal masonry we glimpsed beside us a continuous\nprocession of heroic sculptures in the dead race's early and undecayed\ntechnique--a farewell from the Old Ones, written fifty million years\nago.\nFinally, scrambling out at the top, we found ourselves on a great mound\nof tumbled blocks, with the curved walls of higher stonework rising\nwestward, and the brooding peaks of the great mountains showing beyond\nthe more crumbled structures toward the east.\n",
        "447": "The sky above was a churning and opalescent mass of tenuous ice vapors,\nand the cold clutched at our vitals.\nIn less than a quarter of an hour we had found the steep grade to the\nfoothills--the probable ancient terrace--by which we had descended, and\ncould see the dark bulk of our great plane amidst the sparse ruins on\nthe rising slope ahead.\nHalfway uphill toward our goal we paused for a momentary breathing\nspell, and turned to look again at the fantastic tangle of incredible\nstone shapes below us--once more outlined mystically against an unknown\nwest. As we did so we saw that the sky beyond had lost its morning\n",
        "448": "haziness; the restless ice vapors having moved up to the zenith, where\ntheir mocking outlines seemed on the point of settling into some\nbizarre pattern which they feared to make quite definite or conclusive.\n       *       *       *       *       *\nThere now lay revealed on the ultimate white horizon behind\nthe grotesque city a dim, elfin line of pinnacled violet whose\nneedle-pointed heights loomed dreamlike against the beckoning rose\ncolor of the western sky. Up toward this shimmering rim sloped the\nancient table-land, the depressed course of the bygone river traversing\nit as an irregular ribbon of shadow.\n",
        "449": "For a second we gasped in admiration of the scene's unearthly cosmic\nbeauty, and then vague horror began to creep into our souls. For this\nfar violet line could be nothing else than the terrible mountains of\nthe forbidden land--highest of earth's peaks and focus of earth's evil;\nharborers of nameless horrors and Arch\u00e6an secrets; shunned and prayed\nto by those who feared to carve their meaning; untrodden by any living\nthing of earth, but visited by the sinister lightnings and sending\nstrange beams across the plains in the polar night.\nIf the sculptured maps and pictures in that prehuman city had told\ntruly, these cryptic violet mountains could not be much less than three\nhundred miles away; yet none the less sharply did their dim elfin\nessence jut above that remote and snowy rim, like the serrated edge of\na monstrous alien planet about to rise into unaccustomed heavens.\n",
        "450": "Looking at them, I thought nervously of certain sculptured hints of\nwhat the great bygone river had washed down into the city from their\naccursed sloping--and wondered how much sense and how much folly had\nlain in the fears of those Old Ones who carved them so reticently.\nI recalled how their northerly end must come near the coast at Queen\nMary Land, where even at that moment Sir Douglas Mawson's expedition\nwas doubtless working less than a thousand miles away; and hoped that\nno evil fate would give Sir Douglas and his men a glimpse of what\nmight lie beyond the protecting coastal range. Such thoughts formed a\nmeasure of my overwrought condition at the time--and Danforth seemed to\nbe even worse.\n",
        "451": "Yet before we had passed the great star-shaped ruin and reached our\nplane our fears had become transferred to the lesser, but vast enough,\nrange whose re-crossing lay ahead of us.\nFrom these foothills the black, ruin-crusted slopes reared up starkly\nand hideously against the east, again reminding us of those strange\nAsian paintings of Nicholas Roerich; and when we thought of the\ndamnable honeycombings inside them, and of the frightful amorphous\nentities that might have pushed their fetidly squirming sway even to\nthe topmost hollow pinnacles, we could not face without panic the\nprospect of again sailing by those suggestive skyward cave mouths where\nthe wind made sounds like an evil musical piping over a wide range.\nTo make matters worse, we saw distinct traces of local mist around\nseveral of the summits--as poor Lake must have done when he made that\nearly mistake about volcanism--and thought shiveringly of that kindred\nmist from which we had just escaped--of that, and of the blasphemous,\nhorror-fostering abyss whence all such vapors came.\n",
        "452": "       *       *       *       *       *\nAll was well with the plane, and we clumsily hauled on our heavy flying\nfurs. Danforth got the engine started without trouble, and we made a\nvery smooth take-off over the nightmare city.\nAt a very high level there must have been great disturbance, since the\nice-dust clouds of the zenith were doing all sorts of fantastic things;\nbut at twenty-four thousand feet, the height we needed for the pass, we\nfound navigation quite practicable.\n",
        "453": "As we drew close to the jutting peaks the wind's strange piping again\nbecame manifest, and I could see Danforth's hands trembling at the\ncontrols. Rank amateur though I was, I thought at that moment that I\nmight be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous crossing\nbetween pinnacles; and when I made motions to change seats and take\nover his duties he did not protest.\nI tried to keep all my skill and self-possession about me, and stared\nat the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt the walls of the pass.\n",
        "454": "But Danforth, released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous\nnervous pitch, could not keep quiet. I felt him turning and wriggling\nabout as he looked back at the terrible receding city, ahead at the\ncave-riddled, cube-barnacled peaks, sidewise at the bleak sea of snowy,\nrampart-strown foothills, and upward at the seething, grotesquely\nclouded sky.\nIt was then, just as I was trying to steer safely through the pass,\nthat his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster, by shattering\nmy tight hold on myself and causing me to fumble helplessly with the\ncontrols for a moment. A second afterward my resolution triumphed and\n",
        "455": "we made the crossing safely----Yet I am afraid that Danforth will never\nbe the same again.\nI have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him\nscream out so insanely--a horror which, I feel sadly sure, is mainly\nresponsible for his present breakdown. We had snatches of shouted\nconversation above the wind's piping and the engine's buzzing as we\nreached the safe side of the range and swooped slowly down toward the\ncamp, but that had mostly to do with the pledges of secrecy we had made\nas we prepared to leave the nightmare city.\n",
        "456": "       *       *       *       *       *\nAll that Danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a\nmirage. It was not, he declares, anything connected with the cubes\nand caves of those echoing, vaporous, wormily honeycombed mountains\nof madness which we crossed; but a single fantastic, demonic glimpse,\namong the churning westward zenith clouds, of what lay back of those\nother violet westward mountains which the Old Ones had shunned and\nfeared.\nHe has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things\nabout \"the black pit,\" \"the carven rim,\" \"the proto-Shoggoths,\" \"the\nwindowless solids with five dimensions,\" \"the nameless cylinders,\" \"the\nelder pharos,\" \"Yog-Sothoth,\" \"the primal white jelly,\" \"the color out\nof space,\" \"the wings,\" \"the eyes in darkness,\" \"the moon-ladder,\" \"the\noriginal, the eternal, the undying,\" and other bizarre conceptions;\nbut when he is fully himself he repudiates all this and attributes it\nto his curious and macabre reading of earlier years. Danforth, indeed,\n",
        "457": "is known to be among the few who have ever dared go completely through\nthat worm-riddled copy of the _Necronomicon_ kept under lock and key in\nthe college library.\nThe higher sky, as we crossed the range, was surely vaporous and\ndisturbed enough; and although I did not see the zenith I can well\nimagine that its swirls of ice dust may have taken strange forms.\nImagination, knowing how vividly distant scenes can sometimes be\nreflected, refracted, and magnified by such layers of restless cloud,\nmight easily have supplied the rest--and, of course, Danforth did not\nhint any of these specific horrors till after his memory had had a\nchance to draw on his bygone reading. He could never have seen so much\n",
        "458": "in one instantaneous glance.\nAt the time, his shrieks were confined to the repetition of a single,\nmad word of all too obvious source: \"_Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!_\"\n                                THE END\n"
