The Cuban and\nHawaiian investments had paid one hundred per cent and the territory of\nSamoa was well worth its cost as a coaling station. The country was in a\nsuperb state of defence.

The gentlemen from the West had at last been constrained to\nacknowledge that a college for the training of diplomats was as necessary\nas law schools are for the training of barristers; consequently we were no\nlonger represented abroad by incompetent patriots. The nation was\nprosperous; Chicago, for a moment paralyzed after a second great fire, had\nrisen from its ruins, white and imperial, and more beautiful than the white\ncity which had been built for its plaything in 1893.

Streets\nhad been widened, properly paved and lighted, trees had been planted,\nsquares laid out, elevated structures demolished and underground roads\nbuilt to replace them. The new government buildings and barracks were fine\nbits of architecture, and the long system of stone quays which completely\nsurrounded the island had been turned into parks which proved a god-send\nto the population. The subsidizing of the state theatre and state opera\n",

When the\nGovernment solved the Indian problem and squadrons of Indian cavalry\nscouts in native costume were substituted for the pitiable organizations\ntacked on to the tail of skeletonized regiments by a former Secretary of\nWar, the nation drew a long sigh of relief.

        "11": "where I had been as a mere formality. Ever since that fall from my horse,\nfour years before, I had been troubled at times with pains in the back of\nmy head and neck, but now for months they had been absent, and the doctor\nsent me away that day saying there was nothing more to be cured in me. It\nwas hardly worth his fee to be told that; I knew it myself. Still I did\n",
        "12": "not grudge him the money. What I minded was the mistake which he made at\nfirst.

        "13": "in his private asylum where I was obliged to endure treatment for\ninsanity. At last he decided that I was well, and I, knowing that my mind\nhad always been as sound as his, if not sounder, \"paid my tuition\" as he\njokingly called it, and left. I told him, smiling, that I would get even\nwith him for his mistake, and he laughed heartily, and asked me to call\nonce in a while. I did so, hoping for a chance to even up accounts, but\n",
        "14": "he gave me none, and I told him I would wait.\nThe fall from my horse had fortunately left no evil results; on the\ncontrary it had changed my whole character for the better. From a lazy\nyoung man about town, I had become active, energetic, temperate, and\nabove all--oh, above all else--ambitious. There was only one thing which\n",
        "15": "troubled me, I laughed at my own uneasiness, and yet it troubled me.\nDuring my convalescence I had bought and read for the first time, _The\nKing in Yellow_. I remember after finishing the first act that it\noccurred to me that I had better stop. I started up and flung the book\n",
        "16": "into the fireplace; the volume struck the barred grate and fell open on\nthe hearth in the firelight. If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening\nwords in the second act I should never have finished it, but as I stooped\nto pick it up, my eyes became riveted to the open page, and with a cry of\nterror, or perhaps it was of joy so poignant that I suffered in every\nnerve, I snatched the thing out of the coals and crept shaking to my\nbedroom, where I read it and reread it, and wept and laughed and trembled\nwith a horror which at times assails me yet. This is the thing that\ntroubles me, for I cannot forget Carcosa where black stars hang in the\nheavens; where the shadows of men's thoughts lengthen in the afternoon,\nwhen the twin suns sink into the lake of Hali; and my mind will bear for\never the memory of the Pallid Mask. I pray God will curse the writer, as\n",

        "18": "principles had been violated in those wicked pages, no doctrine\npromulgated, no convictions outraged. It could not be judged by any known\nstandard, yet, although it was acknowledged that the supreme note of art\nhad been struck in _The King in Yellow_, all felt that human nature\ncould not bear the strain, nor thrive on words in which the essence of\npurest poison lurked. The very banality and innocence of the first act\nonly allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect.\n",
        "19": "It was, I remember, the 13th day of April, 1920, that the first\nGovernment Lethal Chamber was established on the south side of Washington\nSquare, between Wooster Street and South Fifth Avenue. The block which\nhad formerly consisted of a lot of shabby old buildings, used as caf\u00e9s\nand restaurants for foreigners, had been acquired by the Government in\nthe winter of 1898. The French and Italian caf\u00e9s and restaurants were\ntorn down; the whole block was enclosed by a gilded iron railing, and\nconverted into a lovely garden with lawns, flowers and fountains. In the\n",
        "20": "centre of the garden stood a small, white building, severely classical in\narchitecture, and surrounded by thickets of flowers. Six Ionic columns\nsupported the roof, and the single door was of bronze. A splendid marble\ngroup of the \"Fates\" stood before the door, the work of a young American\nsculptor, Boris Yvain, who had died in Paris when only twenty-three years\nold.\n",
        "21": "The inauguration ceremonies were in progress as I crossed University\nPlace and entered the square. I threaded my way through the silent throng\nof spectators, but was stopped at Fourth Street by a cordon of police. A\nregiment of United States lancers were drawn up in a hollow square round\nthe Lethal Chamber. On a raised tribune facing Washington Park stood the\n",
        "22": "Governor of New York, and behind him were grouped the Mayor of New\nYork and Brooklyn, the Inspector-General of Police, the Commandant of\nthe state troops, Colonel Livingston, military aid to the President of the\nUnited States, General Blount, commanding at Governor's Island,\nMajor-General Hamilton, commanding the garrison of New York and Brooklyn,\nAdmiral Buffby of the fleet in the North River, Surgeon-General\nLanceford, the staff of the National Free Hospital, Senators Wyse and\nFranklin of New York, and the Commissioner of Public Works. The tribune\nwas surrounded by a squadron of hussars of the National Guard.\nThe Governor was finishing his reply to the short speech of the\nSurgeon-General. I heard him say: \"The laws prohibiting suicide and\n",
        "23": "providing punishment for any attempt at self-destruction have been\nrepealed. The Government has seen fit to acknowledge the right of man to\nend an existence which may have become intolerable to him, through\nphysical suffering or mental despair. It is believed that the community\nwill be benefited by the removal of such people from their midst. Since\n",
        "24": "the passage of this law, the number of suicides in the United States has\nnot increased. Now the Government has determined to establish a Lethal\nChamber in every city, town and village in the country, it remains to be\nseen whether or not that class of human creatures from whose desponding\nranks new victims of self-destruction fall daily will accept the relief\nthus provided.\" He paused, and turned to the white Lethal Chamber. The\nsilence in the street was absolute. \"There a painless death awaits him\n",
        "25": "who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life. If death is welcome let\nhim seek it there.\" Then quickly turning to the military aid of the\nPresident's household, he said, \"I declare the Lethal Chamber open,\" and\nagain facing the vast crowd he cried in a clear voice: \"Citizens of New\nYork and of the United States of America, through me the Government\ndeclares the Lethal Chamber to be open.\"\n",
        "26": "The solemn hush was broken by a sharp cry of command, the squadron of\nhussars filed after the Governor's carriage, the lancers wheeled and\nformed along Fifth Avenue to wait for the commandant of the garrison, and\nthe mounted police followed them. I left the crowd to gape and stare at\nthe white marble Death Chamber, and, crossing South Fifth Avenue, walked\nalong the western side of that thoroughfare to Bleecker Street. Then I\nturned to the right and stopped before a dingy shop which bore the sign:\nHAWBERK, ARMOURER.\n",
        "27": "I glanced in at the doorway and saw Hawberk busy in his little shop at\nthe end of the hall. He looked up, and catching sight of me cried in his\ndeep, hearty voice, \"Come in, Mr. Castaigne!\" Constance, his daughter,\nrose to meet me as I crossed the threshold, and held out her pretty\nhand, but I saw the blush of disappointment on her cheeks, and knew\nthat it was another Castaigne she had expected, my cousin Louis. I\n",
        "28": "smiled at her confusion and complimented her on the banner she was\nembroidering from a coloured plate. Old Hawberk sat riveting the worn\ngreaves of some ancient suit of armour, and the ting! ting! ting! of his\nlittle hammer sounded pleasantly in the quaint shop. Presently he\n",
        "29": "dropped his hammer, and fussed about for a moment with a tiny wrench.\nThe soft clash of the mail sent a thrill of pleasure through me. I\nloved to hear the music of steel brushing against steel, the mellow\nshock of the mallet on thigh pieces, and the jingle of chain armour.\n",
        "30": "That was the only reason I went to see Hawberk. He had never interested\nme personally, nor did Constance, except for the fact of her being in\nlove with Louis. This did occupy my attention, and sometimes even kept\nme awake at night. But I knew in my heart that all would come right,\n",
        "31": "and that I should arrange their future as I expected to arrange that of\nmy kind doctor, John Archer. However, I should never have troubled\nmyself about visiting them just then, had it not been, as I say, that\nthe music of the tinkling hammer had for me this strong fascination. I\nwould sit for hours, listening and listening, and when a stray sunbeam\nstruck the inlaid steel, the sensation it gave me was almost too keen\nto endure. My eyes would become fixed, dilating with a pleasure that\n",
        "32": "stretched every nerve almost to breaking, until some movement of the\nold armourer cut off the ray of sunlight, then, still thrilling\nsecretly, I leaned back and listened again to the sound of the\npolishing rag, swish! swish! rubbing rust from the rivets.\nConstance worked with the embroidery over her knees, now and then pausing\nto examine more closely the pattern in the coloured plate from the\nMetropolitan Museum.\n\"Who is this for?\" I asked.\n",
        "33": "Hawberk explained, that in addition to the treasures of armour in the\nMetropolitan Museum of which he had been appointed armourer, he also\nhad charge of several collections belonging to rich amateurs. This was the\nmissing greave of a famous suit which a client of his had traced to a\nlittle shop in Paris on the Quai d'Orsay. He, Hawberk, had negotiated for\nand secured the greave, and now the suit was complete. He laid down his\n",
        "34": "hammer and read me the history of the suit, traced since 1450 from owner\nto owner until it was acquired by Thomas Stainbridge. When his superb\ncollection was sold, this client of Hawberk's bought the suit, and since\nthen the search for the missing greave had been pushed until it was,\nalmost by accident, located in Paris.\n\"Did you continue the search so persistently without any certainty of the\ngreave being still in existence?\" I demanded.\n",
        "35": "\"Of course,\" he replied coolly.\nThen for the first time I took a personal interest in Hawberk.\n\"It was worth something to you,\" I ventured.\n",
        "36": "\"No,\" he replied, laughing, \"my pleasure in finding it was my reward.\"\n\"Have you no ambition to be rich?\" I asked, smiling.\n\"My one ambition is to be the best armourer in the world,\" he answered\ngravely.\n",
        "37": "Constance asked me if I had seen the ceremonies at the Lethal Chamber.\nShe herself had noticed cavalry passing up Broadway that morning, and had\nwished to see the inauguration, but her father wanted the banner\nfinished, and she had stayed at his request.\n\"Did you see your cousin, Mr. Castaigne, there?\" she asked, with the\n",
        "38": "slightest tremor of her soft eyelashes.\n\"No,\" I replied carelessly. \"Louis' regiment is manoeuvring out in\nWestchester County.\" I rose and picked up my hat and cane.\n",
        "39": "\"Are you going upstairs to see the lunatic again?\" laughed old Hawberk.\nIf Hawberk knew how I loathe that word \"lunatic,\" he would never use it\nin my presence. It rouses certain feelings within me which I do not care\nto explain. However, I answered him quietly: \"I think I shall drop in and\n",
        "40": "see Mr. Wilde for a moment or two.\"\n\"Poor fellow,\" said Constance, with a shake of the head, \"it must be hard\nto live alone year after year poor, crippled and almost demented. It is\nvery good of you, Mr. Castaigne, to visit him as often as you do.\"\n",
        "41": "\"I think he is vicious,\" observed Hawberk, beginning again with his\nhammer. I listened to the golden tinkle on the greave plates; when he had\nfinished I replied:\n\"No, he is not vicious, nor is he in the least demented. His mind is a\nwonder chamber, from which he can extract treasures that you and I would\ngive years of our life to acquire.\"'\n",
        "42": "Hawberk laughed.\nI continued a little impatiently: \"He knows history as no one else could\nknow it. Nothing, however trivial, escapes his search, and his memory is\nso absolute, so precise in details, that were it known in New York that\nsuch a man existed, the people could not honour him enough.\"\n",
        "43": "\"Nonsense,\" muttered Hawberk, searching on the floor for a fallen rivet.\n\"Is it nonsense,\" I asked, managing to suppress what I felt, \"is it\nnonsense when he says that the tassets and cuissards of the enamelled\nsuit of armour commonly known as the 'Prince's Emblazoned' can be found\namong a mass of rusty theatrical properties, broken stoves and\nragpicker's refuse in a garret in Pell Street?\"\nHawberk's hammer fell to the ground, but he picked it up and asked, with\na great deal of calm, how I knew that the tassets and left cuissard were\nmissing from the \"Prince's Emblazoned.\"\n",
        "44": "\"I did not know until Mr. Wilde mentioned it to me the other day. He said\nthey were in the garret of 998 Pell Street.\"\n\"Nonsense,\" he cried, but I noticed his hand trembling under his leathern\napron.\n",
        "45": "\"Is this nonsense too?\" I asked pleasantly, \"is it nonsense when Mr.\nWilde continually speaks of you as the Marquis of Avonshire and of Miss\nConstance--\"\nI did not finish, for Constance had started to her feet with terror\nwritten on every feature. Hawberk looked at me and slowly smoothed his\nleathern apron.\n",
        "46": "\"That is impossible,\" he observed, \"Mr. Wilde may know a great many\nthings--\"\n\"About armour, for instance, and the 'Prince's Emblazoned,'\" I\ninterposed, smiling.\n\"Yes,\" he continued, slowly, \"about armour also--may be--but he is wrong\nin regard to the Marquis of Avonshire, who, as you know, killed his\nwife's traducer years ago, and went to Australia where he did not long\nsurvive his wife.\"\n",
        "47": "\"Mr. Wilde is wrong,\" murmured Constance. Her lips were blanched, but her\nvoice was sweet and calm.\n\"Let us agree, if you please, that in this one circumstance Mr. Wilde is\n",
        "48": "wrong,\" I said.\nII\nI climbed the three dilapidated flights of stairs, which I had so often\nclimbed before, and knocked at a small door at the end of the corridor.\nMr. Wilde opened the door and I walked in.\n",
        "49": "When he had double-locked the door and pushed a heavy chest against it,\nhe came and sat down beside me, peering up into my face with his little\nlight-coloured eyes. Half a dozen new scratches covered his nose and\ncheeks, and the silver wires which supported his artificial ears had\nbecome displaced. I thought I had never seen him so hideously\nfascinating. He had no ears. The artificial ones, which now stood out at\n",
        "50": "an angle from the fine wire, were his one weakness. They were made of wax\nand painted a shell pink, but the rest of his face was yellow. He might\nbetter have revelled in the luxury of some artificial fingers for his\nleft hand, which was absolutely fingerless, but it seemed to cause him no\ninconvenience, and he was satisfied with his wax ears. He was very small,\n",
        "51": "scarcely higher than a child of ten, but his arms were magnificently\ndeveloped, and his thighs as thick as any athlete's. Still, the most\nremarkable thing about Mr. Wilde was that a man of his marvellous\nintelligence and knowledge should have such a head. It was flat and\n",
        "52": "pointed, like the heads of many of those unfortunates whom people\nimprison in asylums for the weak-minded. Many called him insane, but I\nknew him to be as sane as I was.\nI do not deny that he was eccentric; the mania he had for keeping that\ncat and teasing her until she flew at his face like a demon, was\ncertainly eccentric. I never could understand why he kept the creature,\n",
        "53": "nor what pleasure he found in shutting himself up in his room with this\nsurly, vicious beast. I remember once, glancing up from the manuscript I\nwas studying by the light of some tallow dips, and seeing Mr. Wilde\nsquatting motionless on his high chair, his eyes fairly blazing with\nexcitement, while the cat, which had risen from her place before the\nstove, came creeping across the floor right at him. Before I could move\n",
        "54": "she flattened her belly to the ground, crouched, trembled, and sprang\ninto his face. Howling and foaming they rolled over and over on the\nfloor, scratching and clawing, until the cat screamed and fled under the\ncabinet, and Mr. Wilde turned over on his back, his limbs contracting and\ncurling up like the legs of a dying spider. He _was_ eccentric.\n",
        "55": "Mr. Wilde had climbed into his high chair, and, after studying my face,\npicked up a dog's-eared ledger and opened it.\n\"Henry B. Matthews,\" he read, \"book-keeper with Whysot Whysot and\n",
        "56": "Company, dealers in church ornaments. Called April 3rd. Reputation\ndamaged on the race-track. Known as a welcher. Reputation to be repaired\nby August 1st. Retainer Five Dollars.\" He turned the page and ran his\n",

        "58": "Retainer $100.\"\nHe coughed and added, \"Called, April 6th.\"\n\"Then you are not in need of money, Mr. Wilde,\" I inquired.\n",

        "61": "\"Well,\" I said, \"the profession of a Repairer of Reputations is\nlucrative.\"\nHis colourless eyes sought mine, \"I only wanted to demonstrate that I\nwas correct.

I choose them at my\nleisure from those who reply to my advertisements. It is easy enough,\n",
        "63": "they are all cowards. I could treble the number in twenty days if I\nwished. So you see, those who have in their keeping the reputations of\ntheir fellow-citizens, I have in my pay.\"\n",
        "64": "\"They may turn on you,\" I suggested.\nHe rubbed his thumb over his cropped ears, and adjusted the wax\nsubstitutes. \"I think not,\" he murmured thoughtfully, \"I seldom have to\napply the whip, and then only once. Besides they like their wages.\"\n",
        "65": "\"How do you apply the whip?\" I demanded.\nHis face for a moment was awful to look upon. His eyes dwindled to a pair\nof green sparks.\n",
        "66": "\"I invite them to come and have a little chat with me,\" he said in a soft\nvoice.\nA knock at the door interrupted him, and his face resumed its amiable\nexpression.\n\"Who is it?\" he inquired.\n",
        "67": "\"Mr. Steylette,\" was the answer.\n\"Come to-morrow,\" replied Mr. Wilde.\n\"Impossible,\" began the other, but was silenced by a sort of bark from\nMr. Wilde.\n",
        "68": "\"Come to-morrow,\" he repeated.\nWe heard somebody move away from the door and turn the corner by the\nstairway.\n\"Who is that?\" I asked.\n",
        "69": "\"Arnold Steylette, Owner and Editor in Chief of the great New York\ndaily.\"\nHe drummed on the ledger with his fingerless hand adding: \"I pay him very\nbadly, but he thinks it a good bargain.\"\n\"Arnold Steylette!\" I repeated amazed.\n",
        "70": "\"Yes,\" said Mr. Wilde, with a self-satisfied cough.\nThe cat, which had entered the room as he spoke, hesitated, looked up at\nhim and snarled. He climbed down from the chair and squatting on the\nfloor, took the creature into his arms and caressed her. The cat ceased\n",
        "71": "snarling and presently began a loud purring which seemed to increase in\ntimbre as he stroked her. \"Where are the notes?\" I asked. He pointed to\nthe table, and for the hundredth time I picked up the bundle of\nmanuscript entitled--\n\"THE IMPERIAL DYNASTY OF AMERICA.\"\nOne by one I studied the well-worn pages, worn only by my own handling,\nand although I knew all by heart, from the beginning, \"When from Carcosa,\nthe Hyades, Hastur, and Aldebaran,\" to \"Castaigne, Louis de Calvados,\nborn December 19th, 1877,\" I read it with an eager, rapt attention,\npausing to repeat parts of it aloud, and dwelling especially on \"Hildred\nde Calvados, only son of Hildred Castaigne and Edythe Landes Castaigne,\nfirst in succession,\" etc., etc.\n",
        "72": "When I finished, Mr. Wilde nodded and coughed.\n\"Speaking of your legitimate ambition,\" he said, \"how do Constance and\nLouis get along?\"\n\"She loves him,\" I replied simply.\n",
        "73": "The cat on his knee suddenly turned and struck at his eyes, and he flung\nher off and climbed on to the chair opposite me.\n\"And Dr. Archer! But that's a matter you can settle any time you wish,\"\nhe added.\n",
        "74": "\"Yes,\" I replied, \"Dr. Archer can wait, but it is time I saw my cousin\nLouis.\"\n\"It is time,\" he repeated. Then he took another ledger from the table and\n",
        "75": "ran over the leaves rapidly. \"We are now in communication with ten\nthousand men,\" he muttered. \"We can count on one hundred thousand within\nthe first twenty-eight hours, and in forty-eight hours the state will\nrise _en masse_.

        "76": "will not, I mean California and the Northwest, might better never have\nbeen inhabited.

        "83": "\"Yes,\" he said, \"it is time that you saw your cousin Louis.\"\nHe unlocked the door and I picked up my hat and stick and stepped into\nthe corridor. The stairs were dark.

Here I lunched\ncomfortably, read the _Herald_ and the _Meteor_, and finally went\nto the steel safe in my bedroom and set the time combination.

        "112": "\"Do you know what it is worth?\" said Hawberk.\n\"No, fifty dollars, perhaps.\"\n\"It is valued at five hundred, but the owner of the 'Prince's Emblazoned'\nwill give two thousand dollars to the person who completes his suit; that\nreward also belongs to Mr. Wilde.\"\n",
        "113": "\"He doesn't want it! He refuses it!\" I answered angrily. \"What do you\nknow about Mr. Wilde? He doesn't need the money. He is rich--or will\nbe--richer than any living man except myself. What will we care for money\n",

Perhaps it was fortunate for him that he\n",
        "115": "did not use the word lunatic just then.\n\"No,\" I replied to his unspoken thought, \"I am not mentally weak; my mind\nis as healthy as Mr. Wilde's.

        "116": "of a continent--yes, a hemisphere!\"\n\"Oh,\" said Hawberk.\n\"And eventually,\" I continued more quietly, \"it will secure the happiness\nof the whole world.\"\n",
        "117": "\"And incidentally your own happiness and prosperity as well as Mr.\nWilde's?\"\n\"Exactly,\" I smiled. But I could have throttled him for taking that tone.\n",
        "118": "He looked at me in silence for a while and then said very gently, \"Why\ndon't you give up your books and studies, Mr. Castaigne, and take a tramp\namong the mountains somewhere or other? You used to be fond of fishing.\nTake a cast or two at the trout in the Rangelys.\"\n",
        "119": "\"I don't care for fishing any more,\" I answered, without a shade of\nannoyance in my voice.\n\"You used to be fond of everything,\" he continued; \"athletics, yachting,\nshooting, riding--\"\n\"I have never cared to ride since my fall,\" I said quietly.\n\"Ah, yes, your fall,\" he repeated, looking away from me.\n",
        "120": "I thought this nonsense had gone far enough, so I brought the\nconversation back to Mr. Wilde; but he was scanning my face again in a\nmanner highly offensive to me.\n\"Mr. Wilde,\" he repeated, \"do you know what he did this afternoon? He\n",

        "123": "Louis and Constance came strolling by and stopped to ask if we would join\nthem. Hawberk looked at his watch. At the same moment a puff of smoke\nshot from the casemates of Castle William, and the boom of the sunset gun\nrolled across the water and was re-echoed from the Highlands opposite.\nThe flag came running down from the flag-pole, the bugles sounded on the\nwhite decks of the warships, and the first electric light sparkled out\nfrom the Jersey shore.\n",

        "250": "\"Are you ready?\" chanted Boris. \"Aye ready;\" and arm-in-arm we raced into\nthe dining-room, scandalizing the servants. After all we were not so much\nto blame; Genevi\u00e8ve was eighteen, Boris was twenty-three, and I not quite\ntwenty-one.\n",

Next instant he dropped my arm and turned pale. \"Good God!\" he\nsaid, \"I forgot the pool is full of the solution!\"\n",

I went back to the studio, and resumed my work. It was a\nRenaissance screen, which Boris wanted me to paint for Genevi\u00e8ve's\nboudoir.

        "274": "\"You are not prepared to call it life, I suppose,\" he answered.

I felt a faint chill, and my heart sank;\n",

        "400": "\"Is that the man you don't like?\" she whispered.\nI nodded.\n\"I can't see his face, but he does look fat and soft. Someway or other,\"\n",
        "401": "she continued, turning to look at me, \"he reminds me of a dream,--an\nawful dream I once had. Or,\" she mused, looking down at her shapely\nshoes, \"was it a dream after all?\"\n\"How should I know?\" I smiled.\n",
        "402": "Tessie smiled in reply.\n\"You were in it,\" she said, \"so perhaps you might know something about\nit.\"\n\"Tessie! Tessie!\" I protested, \"don't you dare flatter by saying that you\n",
        "403": "dream about me!\"\n\"But I did,\" she insisted; \"shall I tell you about it?\"\n\"Go ahead,\" I replied, lighting a cigarette.\n",
        "404": "Tessie leaned back on the open window-sill and began very seriously.\n\"One night last winter I was lying in bed thinking about nothing at all\nin particular.

        "407": "approached, and, finally, I could make out a vehicle moving along the\nstreet. It came nearer and nearer, and when it passed beneath my window I\nsaw it was a hearse.

        "408": "shivering with cold, but the black-plumed hearse and the driver were\ngone. I dreamed this dream again in March last, and again awoke beside\nthe open window.

        "409": "\"But where did I come into the dream?\" I asked.\n\"You--you were in the coffin; but you were not dead.\"\n\"In the coffin?\"\n",

        "414": "the hearse pass below my window, and every time the driver turned and\nlooked up at me. Oh, his face was so white and--and soft? It looked\ndead--it looked as if it had been dead a long time.\"\nI induced the girl to sit down and swallow a glass of Marsala. Then I sat\n",
        "415": "down beside her, and tried to give her some advice.\n\"Look here, Tessie,\" I said, \"you go to the country for a week or two,\nand you'll have no more dreams about hearses. You pose all day, and when\nnight comes your nerves are upset. You can't keep this up. Then again,\n",

        "418": "the face of the man below in the churchyard is the face of the man who\ndrove the hearse!\"\n\"What of it?\" I said. \"It's an honest trade.\"\n\"Then you think I _did_ see the hearse?\"\n",
        "419": "\"Oh,\" I said diplomatically, \"if you really did, it might not be unlikely\nthat the man below drove it. There is nothing in that.\"\nTessie rose, unrolled her scented handkerchief, and taking a bit of gum\nfrom a knot in the hem, placed it in her mouth.

        "527": "\"Surely you did not come from Kerselec!\" she repeated.\nHer sweet voice had no trace of the Breton accent nor of any accent which\nI knew, and yet there was something in it I seemed to have heard before,\nsomething quaint and indefinable, like the theme of an old song.\nI explained that I was an American, unacquainted with Finist\u00e8re, shooting\nthere for my own amusement.\n",
        "528": "\"An American,\" she repeated in the same quaint musical tones. \"I have\nnever before seen an American.\"\nFor a moment she stood silent, then looking at me she said. \"If you\n",
        "529": "should walk all night you could not reach Kerselec now, even if you had a\nguide.\"\nThis was pleasant news.\n\"But,\" I began, \"if I could only find a peasant's hut where I might get\nsomething to eat, and shelter.\"\n",
        "530": "The falcon on her wrist fluttered and shook its head. The girl smoothed\nits glossy back and glanced at me.\n\"Look around,\" she said gently. \"Can you see the end of these moors?\n",
        "531": "Look, north, south, east, west. Can you see anything but moorland and\nbracken?\"\n\"No,\" I said.\n",
        "532": "\"The moor is wild and desolate. It is easy to enter, but sometimes they\nwho enter never leave it. There are no peasants' huts here.\"\n\"Well,\" I said, \"if you will tell me in which direction Kerselec lies,\nto-morrow it will take me no longer to go back than it has to come.\"\n",
        "533": "She looked at me again with an expression almost like pity.\n\"Ah,\" she said, \"to come is easy and takes hours; to go is different--and\nmay take centuries.\"\nI stared at her in amazement but decided that I had misunderstood her.\n",
        "534": "Then before I had time to speak she drew a whistle from her belt and\nsounded it.\n\"Sit down and rest,\" she said to me; \"you have come a long distance and\nare tired.\"\nShe gathered up her pleated skirts and motioning me to follow picked her\ndainty way through the gorse to a flat rock among the ferns.\n",
        "535": "\"They will be here directly,\" she said, and taking a seat at one end of\nthe rock invited me to sit down on the other edge. The after-glow was\nbeginning to fade in the sky and a single star twinkled faintly through\nthe rosy haze. A long wavering triangle of water-fowl drifted southward\nover our heads, and from the swamps around plover were calling.\n",

She caressed and quieted them with her gloved\nhand, speaking to them in quaint terms which I remembered to have seen in\nold French manuscripts.\n",
        "547": "Then the falcons on the circlet borne by the falconer ahead began to beat\ntheir wings and scream, and from somewhere out of sight the notes of a\nhunting-horn floated across the moor. The hounds sprang away before us\nand vanished in the twilight, the falcons flapped and squealed upon their\nperch, and the girl, taking up the song of the horn, began to hum.

        "573": "\"Are you ill at ease?\" she asked again.\nThen, like a man who pronounces his own doom, I answered in a low voice:\n\"Yes, I am ill at ease for love of you.\" And as she did not stir nor\nanswer, the same power moved my lips in spite of me and I said, \"I, who\nam unworthy of the lightest of your thoughts, I who abuse hospitality and\nrepay your gentle courtesy with bold presumption, I love you.\"\n",

        "582": "I began to speak in a vague way of going, but she would not hear of it,\nand before I knew it I had promised to stay a week and hunt with hawk and\nhound in their company. I also obtained permission to come again from\nKerselec and visit her after my return.\n\"Why,\" she said innocently, \"I do not know what I should do if you never\ncame back;\" and I, knowing that I had no right to awaken her with the\nsudden shock which the avowal of my own love would bring to her, sat\nsilent, hardly daring to breathe.\n",

        "591": "She seated herself on the bank of the stream among the falcons and I\nthrew myself at her feet to listen.\nThen the Demoiselle d'Ys held up one rosy-tipped finger and began very\ngravely.\n\"First one must catch the falcon.\"\n",
        "592": "\"I am caught,\" I answered.\nShe laughed very prettily and told me my _dressage_ would perhaps be\ndifficult, as I was noble.\n\"I am already tamed,\" I replied; \"jessed and belled.\"\n",

        "597": "\"Begin,\" I replied; \"we have caught the falcon.\"\nThen Jeanne d'Ys took my hand in both of hers and told me how with\ninfinite patience the young falcon was taught to perch upon the wrist,\nhow little by little it became used to the belled jesses and the\n_chaperon \u00e0 cornette_.\n\"They must first have a good appetite,\" she said; \"then little by little\nI reduce their nourishment; which in falconry we call _p\u00e2t_.

        "599": "After a little he will learn to seize the _leurre_ in motion as I\nwhirl it around my head or drag it over the ground. After this it is easy\nto teach the falcon to strike at game, always remembering to _'faire\ncourtoisie \u00e1 l'oiseau'_, that is, to allow the bird to taste the\nquarry.\"\nA squeal from one of the falcons interrupted her, and she arose to adjust\nthe _longe_ which had become whipped about the _bloc_, but the\nbird still flapped its wings and screamed.\n",
        "600": "\"What _is_ the matter?\" she said. \"Philip, can you see?\"\nI looked around and at first saw nothing to cause the commotion, which\nwas now heightened by the screams and flapping of all the birds.

        "733": "appeared at the corner, glanced curiously at West, who merely nodded\ntoward his door saying, \"Come in; Fallowby's upstairs.\"\n\"What are you doing with that knife?\" demanded Fallowby, as he and Trent\nentered the studio.\n",
        "734": "West looked at his wounded hand, which still clutched the knife, but\nsaying, \"Cut myself by accident,\" tossed it into a corner and washed the\nblood from his fingers.\nFallowby, fat and lazy, watched him without comment, but Trent, half\ndivining how things had turned, walked over to Fallowby smiling.\n\"I've a bone to pick with you!\" he said.\n",
        "735": "\"Where is it? I'm hungry,\" replied Fallowby with affected eagerness, but\nTrent, frowning, told him to listen.\n\"How much did I advance you a week ago?\"\n",
        "736": "\"Three hundred and eighty francs,\" replied the other, with a squirm of\ncontrition.\n\"Where is it?\"\nFallowby began a series of intricate explanations, which were soon cut\nshort by Trent.\n",
        "737": "\"I know; you blew it in;--you always blow it in. I don't care a rap what\nyou did before the siege: I know you are rich and have a right to dispose\nof your money as you wish to, and I also know that, generally speaking, it\nis none of my business. But _now_ it is my business, as I have to supply\nthe funds until you get some more, which you won't until the siege is\nended one way or another. I wish to share what I have, but I won't see it\n",
        "738": "thrown out of the window. Oh, yes, of course I know you will reimburse me,\nbut that isn't the question; and, anyway, it's the opinion of your\nfriends, old man, that you will not be worse off for a little abstinence\nfrom fleshly pleasures. You are positively a freak in this famine-cursed\ncity of skeletons!\"\n",
        "739": "\"I _am_ rather stout,\" he admitted.\n\"Is it true you are out of money?\" demanded Trent.\n\"Yes, I am,\" sighed the other.\n",
        "740": "\"That roast sucking pig on the rue St. Honor\u00e9,--is it there yet?\"\ncontinued Trent.\n\"Wh--at?\" stammered the feeble one.\n",
        "741": "\"Ah--I thought so! I caught you in ecstasy before that sucking pig at\nleast a dozen times!\"\nThen laughing, he presented Fallowby with a roll of twenty franc pieces\nsaying: \"If these go for luxuries you must live on your own flesh,\" and\nwent over to aid West, who sat beside the wash-basin binding up his hand.\n",
        "742": "West suffered him to tie the knot, and then said: \"You remember,\nyesterday, when I left you and Braith to take the chicken to Colette.\"\n\"Chicken! Good heavens!\" moaned Fallowby.\n\"Chicken,\" repeated West, enjoying Fallowby's grief;--\"I--that is, I must\nexplain that things are changed. Colette and I--are to be married--\"\n",
        "743": "\"What--what about the chicken?\" groaned Fallowby.\n\"Shut up!\" laughed Trent, and slipping his arm through West's, walked to\nthe stairway.\n",
        "744": "\"The poor little thing,\" said West, \"just think, not a splinter of\nfirewood for a week and wouldn't tell me because she thought I needed\nit for my clay figure. Whew! When I heard it I smashed that smirking\nclay nymph to pieces, and the rest can freeze and be hanged!\" After a\nmoment he added timidly: \"Won't you call on your way down and say _bon\nsoir_? It's No. 17.\"\n",
        "745": "\"Yes,\" said Trent, and he went out softly closing the door behind.\nHe stopped on the third landing, lighted a match, scanned the numbers over\nthe row of dingy doors, and knocked at No. 17.\n\"C'est toi Georges?\" The door opened.\n",
        "746": "\"Oh, pardon, Monsieur Jack, I thought it was Monsieur West,\" then blushing\nfuriously, \"Oh, I see you have heard! Oh, thank you so much for your\nwishes, and I'm sure we love each other very much,--and I'm dying to see\nSylvia and tell her and--\"\n\"And what?\" laughed Trent.\n\"I am very happy,\" she sighed.\n",
        "747": "\"He's pure gold,\" returned Trent, and then gaily: \"I want you and George\nto come and dine with us to-night. It's a little treat,--you see to-morrow\nis Sylvia's _f\u00eate_. She will be nineteen. I have written to Thorne, and\nthe Guernalecs will come with their cousin Odile. Fallowby has engaged not\n",
        "748": "to bring anybody but himself.\"\nThe girl accepted shyly, charging him with loads of loving messages to\nSylvia, and he said good-night.\nHe started up the street, walking swiftly, for it was bitter cold, and\ncutting across the rue de la Lune he entered the rue de Seine. The early\n",
        "749": "winter night had fallen, almost without warning, but the sky was clear and\nmyriads of stars glittered in the heavens. The bombardment had become\nfurious--a steady rolling thunder from the Prussian cannon punctuated by\nthe heavy shocks from Mont Val\u00e9rien.\nThe shells streamed across the sky leaving trails like shooting stars, and\nnow, as he turned to look back, rockets blue and red flared above the\nhorizon from the Fort of Issy, and the Fortress of the North flamed like a\nbonfire.\n",
        "750": "\"Good news!\" a man shouted over by the Boulevard St. Germain. As if by\nmagic the streets were filled with people,--shivering, chattering people\nwith shrunken eyes.\n\"Jacques!\" cried one. \"The Army of the Loire!\"\n",
        "751": "\"Eh! _mon vieux_, it has come then at last! I told thee! I told thee!\nTo-morrow--to-night--who knows?\"\n\"Is it true? Is it a sortie?\"\n",
        "752": "Some one said: \"Oh, God--a sortie--and my son?\" Another cried: \"To the\nSeine? They say one can see the signals of the Army of the Loire from the\nPont Neuf.\"\n",
        "753": "There was a child standing near Trent who kept repeating: \"Mamma, Mamma,\nthen to-morrow we may eat white bread?\" and beside him, an old man\nswaying, stumbling, his shrivelled hands crushed to his breast, muttering\nas if insane.\n\"Could it be true? Who has heard the news? The shoemaker on the rue de\n",
        "754": "Buci had it from a Mobile who had heard a Franctireur repeat it to a\ncaptain of the National Guard.\"\nTrent followed the throng surging through the rue de Seine to the river.\nRocket after rocket clove the sky, and now, from Montmartre, the cannon\nclanged, and the batteries on Montparnasse joined in with a crash. The\n",
        "755": "bridge was packed with people.\nTrent asked: \"Who has seen the signals of the Army of the Loire?\"\n\"We are waiting for them,\" was the reply.\n",
        "756": "He looked toward the north. Suddenly the huge silhouette of the Arc de\nTriomphe sprang into black relief against the flash of a cannon. The boom\nof the gun rolled along the quay and the old bridge vibrated.\n",
        "757": "Again over by the Point du Jour a flash and heavy explosion shook the\nbridge, and then the whole eastern bastion of the fortifications blazed\nand crackled, sending a red flame into the sky.\n\"Has any one seen the signals yet?\" he asked again.\n\"We are waiting,\" was the reply.\n",
        "758": "\"Yes, waiting,\" murmured a man behind him, \"waiting, sick, starved,\nfreezing, but waiting. Is it a sortie? They go gladly. Is it to starve?\nThey starve. They have no time to think of surrender. Are they\nheroes,--these Parisians? Answer me, Trent!\"\n",
        "759": "The American Ambulance surgeon turned about and scanned the parapets of\nthe bridge.\n\"Any news, Doctor,\" asked Trent mechanically.\n\"News?\" said the doctor; \"I don't know any;--I haven't time to know any.\n",
        "760": "What are these people after?\"\n\"They say that the Army of the Loire has signalled Mont Val\u00e9rien.\"\n\"Poor devils.\" The doctor glanced about him for an instant, and then: \"I'm\n",
        "761": "so harried and worried that I don't know what to do. After the last sortie\nwe had the work of fifty ambulances on our poor little corps. To-morrow\nthere's another sortie, and I wish you fellows could come over to\nheadquarters. We may need volunteers. How is madame?\" he added abruptly.\n",
        "762": "\"Well,\" replied Trent, \"but she seems to grow more nervous every day. I\nought to be with her now.\"\n\"Take care of her,\" said the doctor, then with a sharp look at the people:\n\"I can't stop now--goodnight!\" and he hurried away muttering, \"Poor\n",
        "763": "devils!\"\nTrent leaned over the parapet and blinked at the black river surging\nthrough the arches. Dark objects, carried swiftly on the breast of the\ncurrent, struck with a grinding tearing noise against the stone piers,\nspun around for an instant, and hurried away into the darkness. The ice\n",
        "764": "from the Marne.\nAs he stood staring into the water, a hand was laid on his shoulder.\n\"Hello, Southwark!\" he cried, turning around; \"this is a queer place for\n",
        "765": "you!\"\n\"Trent, I have something to tell you. Don't stay here,--don't believe in\nthe Army of the Loire:\" and the _attach\u00e9_ of the American Legation slipped\nhis arm through Trent's and drew him toward the Louvre.\n",
        "766": "\"Then it's another lie!\" said Trent bitterly.\n\"Worse--we know at the Legation--I can't speak of it. But that's not what\nI have to say. Something happened this afternoon. The Alsatian Brasserie\n",
        "767": "was visited and an American named Hartman has been arrested. Do you know\nhim?\"\n\"I know a German who calls himself an American;--his name is Hartman.\"\n",
        "768": "\"Well, he was arrested about two hours ago. They mean to shoot him.\"\n\"What!\"\n\"Of course we at the Legation can't allow them to shoot him off-hand, but\nthe evidence seems conclusive.\"\n",
        "769": "\"Is he a spy?\"\n\"Well, the papers seized in his rooms are pretty damning proofs, and\nbesides he was caught, they say, swindling the Public Food Committee. He\ndrew rations for fifty, how, I don't know. He claims to be an American\n",
        "770": "artist here, and we have been obliged to take notice of it at the\nLegation. It's a nasty affair.\"\n\"To cheat the people at such a time is worse than robbing the poor-box,\"\ncried Trent angrily. \"Let them shoot him!\"\n\"He's an American citizen.\"\n",
        "771": "\"Yes, oh yes,\" said the other with bitterness. \"American citizenship is a\nprecious privilege when every goggle-eyed German--\" His anger choked him.\nSouthwark shook hands with him warmly. \"It can't be helped, we must own\n",
        "772": "the carrion. I am afraid you may be called upon to identify him as an\nAmerican artist,\" he said with a ghost of a smile on his deep-lined face;\nand walked away through the Cours la Reine.\nTrent swore silently for a moment and then drew out his watch. Seven\n",
        "773": "o'clock. \"Sylvia will be anxious,\" he thought, and hurried back to the\nriver. The crowd still huddled shivering on the bridge, a sombre pitiful\ncongregation, peering out into the night for the signals of the Army of\nthe Loire: and their hearts beat time to the pounding of the guns, their\neyes lighted with each flash from the bastions, and hope rose with the\ndrifting rockets.\n",
        "774": "A black cloud hung over the fortifications. From horizon to horizon the\ncannon smoke stretched in wavering bands, now capping the spires and domes\nwith cloud, now blowing in streamers and shreds along the streets, now\ndescending from the housetops, enveloping quays, bridges, and river, in a\nsulphurous mist. And through the smoke pall the lightning of the cannon\nplayed, while from time to time a rift above showed a fathomless black\nvault set with stars.\n",
        "775": "He turned again into the rue de Seine, that sad abandoned street, with its\nrows of closed shutters and desolate ranks of unlighted lamps. He was a\nlittle nervous and wished once or twice for a revolver, but the slinking\nforms which passed him in the darkness were too weak with hunger to be\ndangerous, he thought, and he passed on unmolested to his doorway. But\nthere somebody sprang at his throat. Over and over the icy pavement he\n",
        "776": "rolled with his assailant, tearing at the noose about his neck, and then\nwith a wrench sprang to his feet.\n\"Get up,\" he cried to the other.\nSlowly and with great deliberation, a small gamin picked himself out of\nthe gutter and surveyed Trent with disgust.\n",
        "777": "\"That's a nice clean trick,\" said Trent; \"a whelp of your age! You'll\nfinish against a dead wall! Give me that cord!\"\nThe urchin handed him the noose without a word.\n",
        "778": "Trent struck a match and looked at his assailant. It was the rat-killer of\nthe day before.\n\"H'm! I thought so,\" he muttered.\n",
        "779": "\"Tiens, c'est toi?\" said the gamin tranquilly.\nThe impudence, the overpowering audacity of the ragamuffin took Trent's\nbreath away.\n\"Do you know, you young strangler,\" he gasped, \"that they shoot thieves of\nyour age?\"\n",
        "780": "The child turned a passionless face to Trent. \"Shoot, then.\"\nThat was too much, and he turned on his heel and entered his hotel.\nGroping up the unlighted stairway, he at last reached his own landing and\nfelt about in the darkness for the door. From his studio came the sound of\n",
        "781": "voices, West's hearty laugh and Fallowby's chuckle, and at last he found\nthe knob and, pushing back the door, stood a moment confused by the light.\n\"Hello, Jack!\" cried West, \"you're a pleasant creature, inviting people to\ndine and letting them wait. Here's Fallowby weeping with hunger--\"\n",
        "782": "\"Shut up,\" observed the latter, \"perhaps he's been out to buy a turkey.\"\n\"He's been out garroting, look at his noose!\" laughed Guernalec.\n\"So now we know where you get your cash!\" added West; \"vive le coup du\n",
        "783": "P\u00e8re Fran\u00e7ois!\"\nTrent shook hands with everybody and laughed at Sylvia's pale face.\n\"I didn't mean to be late; I stopped on the bridge a moment to watch the\nbombardment. Were you anxious, Sylvia?\"\n",
        "784": "She smiled and murmured, \"Oh, no!\" but her hand dropped into his and\ntightened convulsively.\n\"To the table!\" shouted Fallowby, and uttered a joyous whoop.\n",
        "785": "\"Take it easy,\" observed Thorne, with a remnant of manners; \"you are not\nthe host, you know.\"\nMarie Guernalec, who had been chattering with Colette, jumped up and took\nThorne's arm and Monsieur Guernalec drew Odile's arm through his.\nTrent, bowing gravely, offered his own arm to Colette, West took in\nSylvia, and Fallowby hovered anxiously in the rear.\n",
        "786": "\"You march around the table three times singing the Marseillaise,\"\nexplained Sylvia, \"and Monsieur Fallowby pounds on the table and beats\ntime.\"\nFallowby suggested that they could sing after dinner, but his protest was\ndrowned in the ringing chorus--\n  \"Aux armes!\n  Formez vos bataillons!\"\n",
        "787": "Around the room they marched singing,\n  \"Marchons! Marchons!\"\nwith all their might, while Fallowby with very bad grace, hammered on the\ntable, consoling himself a little with the hope that the exercise would\nincrease his appetite. Hercules, the black and tan, fled under the bed,\nfrom which retreat he yapped and whined until dragged out by Guernalec and\nplaced in Odile's lap.\n",
        "788": "\"And now,\" said Trent gravely, when everybody was seated, \"listen!\" and he\nread the menu.\n  Beef Soup \u00e0 la Si\u00e8ge de Paris.\n",
        "789": "  Fish.\n  Sardines \u00e0 la p\u00e8re Lachaise.\n  (White Wine).\n",

        "792": "  Dried prunes--White bread,\n  Currant Jelly,\n  Tea--Caf\u00e9,\n  Liqueurs,\n  Pipes and Cigarettes.\nFallowby applauded frantically, and Sylvia served the soup.\n\"Isn't it delicious?\" sighed Odile.\n",
        "793": "Marie Guernalec sipped her soup in rapture.\n\"Not at all like horse, and I don't care what they say, horse doesn't\ntaste like beef,\" whispered Colette to West. Fallowby, who had finished,\nbegan to caress his chin and eye the tureen.\n",
        "794": "\"Have some more, old chap?\" inquired Trent.\n\"Monsieur Fallowby cannot have any more,\" announced Sylvia; \"I am saving\nthis for the concierge.\" Fallowby transferred his eyes to the fish.\nThe sardines, hot from the grille, were a great success. While the others\n",
        "795": "were eating Sylvia ran downstairs with the soup for the old concierge and\nher husband, and when she hurried back, flushed and breathless, and had\nslipped into her chair with a happy smile at Trent, that young man arose,\nand silence fell over the table. For an instant he looked at Sylvia and\nthought he had never seen her so beautiful.\n\"You all know,\" he began, \"that to-day is my wife's nineteenth birthday--\"\nFallowby, bubbling with enthusiasm, waved his glass in circles about his\nhead to the terror of Odile and Colette, his neighbours, and Thorne, West\nand Guernalec refilled their glasses three times before the storm of\napplause which the toast of Sylvia had provoked, subsided.\n",
        "796": "Three times the glasses were filled and emptied to Sylvia, and again to\nTrent, who protested.\n\"This is irregular,\" he cried, \"the next toast is to the twin Republics,\nFrance and America?\"\n\"To the Republics! To the Republics!\" they cried, and the toast was drunk\n",
        "797": "amid shouts of \"Vive a France! Vive l'Am\u00e9rique! Vive la Nation!\"\nThen Trent, with a smile at West, offered the toast, \"To a Happy Pair!\"\nand everybody understood, and Sylvia leaned over and kissed Colette, while\nTrent bowed to West.\n",
        "798": "The beef was eaten in comparative calm, but when it was finished and a\nportion of it set aside for the old people below, Trent cried: \"Drink to\nParis! May she rise from her ruins and crush the invader!\" and the cheers\nrang out, drowning for a moment the monotonous thunder of the Prussian\nguns.\nPipes and cigarettes were lighted, and Trent listened an instant to the\nanimated chatter around him, broken by ripples of laughter from the girls\nor the mellow chuckle of Fallowby. Then he turned to West.\n",
        "799": "\"There is going to be a sortie to-night,\" he said. \"I saw the American\nAmbulance surgeon just before I came in and he asked me to speak to you\nfellows. Any aid we can give him will not come amiss.\"\nThen dropping his voice and speaking in English, \"As for me, I shall go\nout with the ambulance to-morrow morning. There is of course no danger,\n",
        "800": "but it's just as well to keep it from Sylvia.\"\nWest nodded. Thorne and Guernalec, who had heard, broke in and offered\nassistance, and Fallowby volunteered with a groan.\n",
        "801": "\"All right,\" said Trent rapidly,--\"no more now, but meet me at Ambulance\nheadquarters to-morrow morning at eight.\"\nSylvia and Colette, who were becoming uneasy at the conversation in\nEnglish, now demanded to know what they were talking about.\n\"What does a sculptor usually talk about?\" cried West, with a laugh.\n",
        "802": "Odile glanced reproachfully at Thorne, her _fianc\u00e9_.\n\"You are not French, you know, and it is none of your business, this war,\"\nsaid Odile with much dignity.\nThorne looked meek, but West assumed an air of outraged virtue.\n",
        "803": "\"It seems,\" he said to Fallowby, \"that a fellow cannot discuss the\nbeauties of Greek sculpture in his mother tongue, without being openly\nsuspected.\"\nColette placed her hand over his mouth and turning to Sylvia, murmured,\n\"They are horridly untruthful, these men.\"\n\"I believe the word for ambulance is the same in both languages,\" said\nMarie Guernalec saucily; \"Sylvia, don't trust Monsieur Trent.\"\n",
        "804": "\"Jack,\" whispered Sylvia, \"promise me--\"\nA knock at the studio door interrupted her.\n\"Come in!\" cried Fallowby, but Trent sprang up, and opening the door,\nlooked out. Then with a hasty excuse to the rest, he stepped into the\n",
        "805": "hall-way and closed the door.\nWhen he returned he was grumbling.\n\"What is it, Jack?\" cried West.\n",
        "806": "\"What is it?\" repeated Trent savagely; \"I'll tell you what it is. I have\nreceived a dispatch from the American Minister to go at once and identify\nand claim, as a fellow-countryman and a brother artist, a rascally thief\nand a German spy!\"\n\"Don't go,\" suggested Fallowby.\n",
        "807": "\"If I don't they'll shoot him at once.\"\n\"Let them,\" growled Thorne.\n\"Do you fellows know who it is?\"\n",
        "808": "\"Hartman!\" shouted West, inspired.\nSylvia sprang up deathly white, but Odile slipped her arm around her and\nsupported her to a chair, saying calmly, \"Sylvia has fainted,--it's the\nhot room,--bring some water.\"\nTrent brought it at once.\n",
        "809": "Sylvia opened her eyes, and after a moment rose, and supported by Marie\nGuernalec and Trent, passed into the bedroom.\nIt was the signal for breaking up, and everybody came and shook hands with\nTrent, saying they hoped Sylvia would sleep it off and that it would be\nnothing.\nWhen Marie Guernalec took leave of him, she avoided his eyes, but he spoke\nto her cordially and thanked her for her aid.\n",
        "810": "\"Anything I can do, Jack?\" inquired West, lingering, and then hurried\ndownstairs to catch up with the rest.\nTrent leaned over the banisters, listening to their footsteps and chatter,\nand then the lower door banged and the house was silent. He lingered,\n",
        "811": "staring down into the blackness, biting his lips; then with an impatient\nmovement, \"I am crazy!\" he muttered, and lighting a candle, went into the\nbedroom. Sylvia was lying on the bed. He bent over her, smoothing the\ncurly hair on her forehead.\n",
        "812": "\"Are you better, dear Sylvia?\"\nShe did not answer, but raised her eyes to his. For an instant he met her\ngaze, but what he read there sent a chill to his heart and he sat down\ncovering his face with his hands.\n",
        "813": "At last she spoke in a voice, changed and strained,--a voice which he had\nnever heard, and he dropped his hands and listened, bolt upright in his\nchair.\n\"Jack, it has come at last. I have feared it and trembled,--ah! how often\nhave I lain awake at night with this on my heart and prayed that I might\ndie before you should ever know of it! For I love you, Jack, and if you go\n",
        "814": "away I cannot live.

        "815": "suffered!--but I dared not tell you. And now you know, but you do not know\nthe worst. For him--now--what do I care? He was cruel--oh, so cruel!\"\nShe hid her face in her arms.\n",
        "816": "\"Must I go on? Must I tell you--can you not imagine, oh! Jack--\"\nHe did not stir; his eyes seemed dead.\n\"I--I was so young, I knew nothing, and he said--said that he loved me--\"\nTrent rose and struck the candle with his clenched fist, and the room was\ndark.\n",
        "817": "The bells of St. Sulpice tolled the hour, and she started up, speaking\nwith feverish haste,--\"I must finish! When you told me you loved\nme--you--you asked me nothing; but then, even then, it was too late, and\n_that other life_ which binds me to him, must stand for ever between you\nand me! For there _is another_ whom he has claimed, and is good to. He\n",
        "818": "must not die,--they cannot shoot him, for that _other's_ sake!\"\nTrent sat motionless, but his thoughts ran on in an interminable whirl.\nSylvia, little Sylvia, who shared with him his student life,--who bore\nwith him the dreary desolation of the siege without complaint,--this\nslender blue-eyed girl whom he was so quietly fond of, whom he teased or\ncaressed as the whim suited, who sometimes made him the least bit\nimpatient with her passionate devotion to him,--could this be the same\nSylvia who lay weeping there in the darkness?\n",
        "819": "Then he clinched his teeth. \"Let him die! Let him die!\"--but then,--for\nSylvia's sake, and,--for that _other's_ sake,--Yes, he would go,--he\n_must_ go,--his duty was plain before him. But Sylvia,--he could not be\nwhat he had been to her, and yet a vague terror seized him, now all was\nsaid. Trembling, he struck a light.\n",
        "820": "She lay there, her curly hair tumbled about her face, her small white\nhands pressed to her breast.\nHe could not leave her, and he could not stay. He never knew before that\nhe loved her. She had been a mere comrade, this girl wife of his. Ah! he\n",
        "821": "loved her now with all his heart and soul, and he knew it, only when it\nwas too late. Too late? Why? Then he thought of that _other_ one, binding\nher, linking her forever to the creature, who stood in danger of his life.\nWith an oath he sprang to the door, but the door would not open,--or was\nit that he pressed it back,--locked it,--and flung himself on his knees\nbeside the bed, knowing that he dared not for his life's sake leave what\nwas his all in life.\n",
        "822": "III\nIt was four in the morning when he came out of the Prison of the Condemned\nwith the Secretary of the American Legation. A knot of people had gathered\naround the American Minister's carriage, which stood in front of the\nprison, the horses stamping and pawing in the icy street, the coachman\nhuddled on the box, wrapped in furs. Southwark helped the Secretary into\nthe carriage, and shook hands with Trent, thanking him for coming.\n",

To be ignored by compatriots intensified his depression.\nHe fumbled with his knife and looked at his plate.\n",
        "936": "The thin young lady was talkative enough.

She argued with her mother upon the\n",

        "938": "The big-headed young man looked after them with a knowing cough,\nmurmuring, \"Gay old birds!\"\n\"They look like bad old men, Mr. Bladen,\" said the girl.\nTo this Mr. Bladen smiled and said, \"They've had their day,\" in a tone\n",
        "939": "which implied that he was now having his.\n\"And that's why they all have baggy eyes,\" cried the girl. \"I think it's a\nshame for young gentlemen--\"\n\"Why, Susie!\" said the mother, and the conversation lagged.\n",
        "940": "After a while Mr. Bladen threw down the _Petit Journal_, which he daily\nstudied at the expense of the house, and turning to Hastings, started to\nmake himself agreeable. He began by saying, \"I see you are American.\"\nTo this brilliant and original opening, Hastings, deadly homesick, replied\ngratefully, and the conversation was judiciously nourished by observations\nfrom Miss Susie Byng distinctly addressed to Mr. Bladen. In the course of\n",

        "942": "does. Paris is an awful place for young gentlemen, and Mr. Bladen is a\nhorrid cynic.\"\nMr. Bladen looked gratified.\n",
        "943": "Hastings answered, \"I shall be at the studio all day, and I imagine I\nshall be glad enough to come back at night.\"\nMr. Bladen, who, at a salary of fifteen dollars a week, acted as agent for\nthe Pewly Manufacturing Company of Troy, N.Y., smiled a sceptical smile\n",
        "944": "and withdrew to keep an appointment with a customer on the Boulevard\nMagenta.\nHastings walked into the garden with Mrs. Byng and Susie, and, at their\ninvitation, sat down in the shade before the iron gate.\n",
        "945": "The chestnut trees still bore their fragrant spikes of pink and white, and\nthe bees hummed among the roses, trellised on the white-walled house.\nA faint freshness was in the air.

The sparrows were merry along the curb-stones, taking\n",
        "946": "bath after bath in the water and ruffling their feathers with delight. In\na walled garden across the street a pair of blackbirds whistled among the\nalmond trees.\nHastings swallowed the lump in his throat, for the song of the birds and\nthe ripple of water in a Paris gutter brought back to him the sunny\nmeadows of Millbrook.\n",
        "947": "\"That's a blackbird,\" observed Miss Byng; \"see him there on the bush with\npink blossoms. He's all black except his bill, and that looks as if it had\nbeen dipped in an omelet, as some Frenchman says--\"\n\"Why, Susie!\" said Mrs. Byng.\n\"That garden belongs to a studio inhabited by two Americans,\" continued\nthe girl serenely, \"and I often see them pass. They seem to need a great\n",
        "948": "many models, mostly young and feminine--\"\n\"Why, Susie!\"\n\"Perhaps they prefer painting that kind, but I don't see why they should\ninvite five, with three more young gentlemen, and all get into two cabs\nand drive away singing. This street,\" she continued, \"is dull. There is\nnothing to see except the garden and a glimpse of the Boulevard\nMontparnasse through the rue de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re. No one ever passes\n",
        "949": "except a policeman. There is a convent on the corner.\"\n\"I thought it was a Jesuit College,\" began Hastings, but was at once\noverwhelmed with a Baedecker description of the place, ending with, \"On\none side stand the palatial hotels of Jean Paul Laurens and Guillaume\nBouguereau, and opposite, in the little Passage Stanislas, Carolus Duran\npaints the masterpieces which charm the world.\"\nThe blackbird burst into a ripple of golden throaty notes, and from some\ndistant green spot in the city an unknown wild-bird answered with a frenzy\nof liquid trills until the sparrows paused in their ablutions to look up\nwith restless chirps.\n",
        "950": "Then a butterfly came and sat on a cluster of heliotrope and waved his\ncrimson-banded wings in the hot sunshine. Hastings knew him for a friend,\nand before his eyes there came a vision of tall mulleins and scented\nmilkweed alive with painted wings, a vision of a white house and\nwoodbine-covered piazza,--a glimpse of a man reading and a woman leaning\nover the pansy bed,--and his heart was full. He was startled a moment\nlater by Miss Byng.\n",
        "951": "\"I believe you are homesick!\" Hastings blushed. Miss Byng looked at him\nwith a sympathetic sigh and continued: \"Whenever I felt homesick at first\nI used to go with mamma and walk in the Luxembourg Gardens. I don't know\nwhy it is, but those old-fashioned gardens seemed to bring me nearer home\nthan anything in this artificial city.\"\n",
        "952": "\"But they are full of marble statues,\" said Mrs. Byng mildly; \"I don't see\nthe resemblance myself.\"\n\"Where is the Luxembourg?\" inquired Hastings after a silence.\n",
        "953": "\"Come with me to the gate,\" said Miss Byng. He rose and followed her, and\nshe pointed out the rue Vavin at the foot of the street.\n\"You pass by the convent to the right,\" she smiled; and Hastings went.\n",
        "954": "III\nThe Luxembourg was a blaze of flowers. He walked slowly through the long\navenues of trees, past mossy marbles and old-time columns, and threading\nthe grove by the bronze lion, came upon the tree-crowned terrace above the\nfountain. Below lay the basin shining in the sunlight. Flowering almonds\nencircled the terrace, and, in a greater spiral, groves of chestnuts wound\nin and out and down among the moist thickets by the western palace wing.\n",
        "955": "At one end of the avenue of trees the Observatory rose, its white domes\npiled up like an eastern mosque; at the other end stood the heavy palace,\nwith every window-pane ablaze in the fierce sun of June.\nAround the fountain, children and white-capped nurses armed with bamboo\npoles were pushing toy boats, whose sails hung limp in the sunshine. A\ndark policeman, wearing red epaulettes and a dress sword, watched them for\na while and then went away to remonstrate with a young man who had\nunchained his dog. The dog was pleasantly occupied in rubbing grass and\n",
        "956": "dirt into his back while his legs waved into the air.\nThe policeman pointed at the dog. He was speechless with indignation.\n\"Well, Captain,\" smiled the young fellow.\n",
        "957": "\"Well, Monsieur Student,\" growled the policeman.\n\"What do you come and complain to me for?\"\n\"If you don't chain him I'll take him,\" shouted the policeman.\n",
        "958": "\"What's that to me, mon capitaine?\"\n\"Wha--t! Isn't that bull-dog yours?\"\n\"If it was, don't you suppose I'd chain him?\"\n",
        "959": "The officer glared for a moment in silence, then deciding that as he was a\nstudent he was wicked, grabbed at the dog, who promptly dodged. Around and\naround the flower-beds they raced, and when the officer came too near for\ncomfort, the bull-dog cut across a flower-bed, which perhaps was not\nplaying fair.\nThe young man was amused, and the dog also seemed to enjoy the exercise.\n",
        "960": "The policeman noticed this and decided to strike at the fountain-head of\nthe evil. He stormed up to the student and said, \"As the owner of this\npublic nuisance I arrest you!\"\n\"But,\" objected the other, \"I disclaim the dog.\"\n",
        "961": "That was a poser. It was useless to attempt to catch the dog until three\ngardeners lent a hand, but then the dog simply ran away and disappeared in\nthe rue de Medici.\nThe policeman shambled off to find consolation among the white-capped\nnurses, and the student, looking at his watch, stood up yawning. Then\n",
        "962": "catching sight of Hastings, he smiled and bowed. Hastings walked over to\nthe marble, laughing.\n\"Why, Clifford,\" he said, \"I didn't recognize you.\"\n",
        "963": "\"It's my moustache,\" sighed the other. \"I sacrificed it to humour a whim\nof--of--a friend. What do you think of my dog?\"\n\"Then he is yours?\" cried Hastings.\n",
        "964": "\"Of course. It's a pleasant change for him, this playing tag with\npolicemen, but he is known now and I'll have to stop it. He's gone home.\nHe always does when the gardeners take a hand. It's a pity; he's fond of\n",
        "965": "rolling on lawns.\" Then they chatted for a moment of Hastings' prospects,\nand Clifford politely offered to stand his sponsor at the studio.\n\"You see, old tabby, I mean Dr. Byram, told me about you before I met\n",
        "966": "you,\" explained Clifford, \"and Elliott and I will be glad to do anything\nwe can.\" Then looking at his watch again, he muttered, \"I have just ten\nminutes to catch the Versailles train; au revoir,\" and started to go, but\ncatching sight of a girl advancing by the fountain, took off his hat with\na confused smile.\n\"Why are you not at Versailles?\" she said, with an almost imperceptible\n",
        "967": "acknowledgment of Hastings' presence.\n\"I--I'm going,\" murmured Clifford.\nFor a moment they faced each other, and then Clifford, very red,\nstammered, \"With your permission I have the honour of presenting to you my\nfriend, Monsieur Hastings.\"\n",
        "968": "Hastings bowed low. She smiled very sweetly, but there was something of\nmalice in the quiet inclination of her small Parisienne head.\n\"I could have wished,\" she said, \"that Monsieur Clifford might spare me\nmore time when he brings with him so charming an American.\"\n",
        "969": "\"Must--must I go, Valentine?\" began Clifford.\n\"Certainly,\" she replied.\nClifford took his leave with very bad grace, wincing, when she added, \"And\ngive my dearest love to C\u00e9cile!\" As he disappeared in the rue d'Assas, the\n",
        "970": "girl turned as if to go, but then suddenly remembering Hastings, looked at\nhim and shook her head.\n\"Monsieur Clifford is so perfectly harebrained,\" she smiled, \"it is\nembarrassing sometimes. You have heard, of course, all about his success\nat the Salon?\"\n",
        "971": "He looked puzzled and she noticed it.\n\"You have been to the Salon, of course?\"\n\"Why, no,\" he answered, \"I only arrived in Paris three days ago.\"\n",
        "972": "She seemed to pay little heed to his explanation, but continued: \"Nobody\nimagined he had the energy to do anything good, but on varnishing day the\nSalon was astonished by the entrance of Monsieur Clifford, who strolled\nabout as bland as you please with an orchid in his buttonhole, and a\nbeautiful picture on the line.\"\nShe smiled to herself at the reminiscence, and looked at the fountain.\n\"Monsieur Bouguereau told me that Monsieur Julian was so astonished that\nhe only shook hands with Monsieur Clifford in a dazed manner, and actually\nforgot to pat him on the back! Fancy,\" she continued with much merriment,\n",
        "973": "\"fancy papa Julian forgetting to pat one on the back.\"\nHastings, wondering at her acquaintance with the great Bouguereau, looked\nat her with respect. \"May I ask,\" he said diffidently, \"whether you are a\npupil of Bouguereau?\"\n",
        "974": "\"I?\" she said in some surprise. Then she looked at him curiously. Was he\npermitting himself the liberty of joking on such short acquaintance?\nHis pleasant serious face questioned hers.\n",
        "975": "\"Tiens,\" she thought, \"what a droll man!\"\n\"You surely study art?\" he said.\nShe leaned back on the crooked stick of her parasol, and looked at him.\n",
        "976": "\"Why do you think so?\"\n\"Because you speak as if you did.\"\n\"You are making fun of me,\" she said, \"and it is not good taste.\"\n",
        "977": "She stopped, confused, as he coloured to the roots of his hair.\n\"How long have you been in Paris?\" she said at length.\n\"Three days,\" he replied gravely.\n",
        "978": "\"But--but--surely you are not a nouveau! You speak French too well!\"\nThen after a pause, \"Really are you a nouveau?\"\n\"I am,\" he said.\n",
        "979": "She sat down on the marble bench lately occupied by Clifford, and tilting\nher parasol over her small head looked at him.\n\"I don't believe it.\"\nHe felt the compliment, and for a moment hesitated to declare himself one\nof the despised. Then mustering up his courage, he told her how new and\n",
        "980": "green he was, and all with a frankness which made her blue eyes open very\nwide and her lips part in the sweetest of smiles.\n\"You have never seen a studio?\"\n\"Never.\"\n",
        "981": "\"Nor a model?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"How funny,\" she said solemnly. Then they both laughed.\n",
        "982": "\"And you,\" he said, \"have seen studios?\"\n\"Hundreds.\"\n\"And models?\"\n",
        "983": "\"Millions.\"\n\"And you know Bouguereau?\"\n\"Yes, and Henner, and Constant and Laurens, and Puvis de Chavannes and\nDagnan and Courtois, and--and all the rest of them!\"\n",
        "984": "\"And yet you say you are not an artist.\"\n\"Pardon,\" she said gravely, \"did I say I was not?\"\n\"Won't you tell me?\" he hesitated.\n",
        "985": "At first she looked at him, shaking her head and smiling, then of a sudden\nher eyes fell and she began tracing figures with her parasol in the gravel\nat her feet. Hastings had taken a place on the seat, and now, with his\nelbows on his knees, sat watching the spray drifting above the fountain\njet. A small boy, dressed as a sailor, stood poking his yacht and crying,\n\"I won't go home! I won't go home!\" His nurse raised her hands to Heaven.\n",
        "986": "\"Just like a little American boy,\" thought Hastings, and a pang of\nhomesickness shot through him.\nPresently the nurse captured the boat, and the small boy stood at bay.\n\"Monsieur Ren\u00e9, when you decide to come here you may have your boat.\"\n",
        "987": "The boy backed away scowling.\n\"Give me my boat, I say,\" he cried, \"and don't call me Ren\u00e9, for my\nname's Randall and you know it!\"\n\"Hello!\" said Hastings,--\"Randall?--that's English.\"\n",
        "988": "\"I am American,\" announced the boy in perfectly good English, turning to\nlook at Hastings, \"and she's such a fool she calls me Ren\u00e9 because mamma\ncalls me Ranny--\"\nHere he dodged the exasperated nurse and took up his station behind\nHastings, who laughed, and catching him around the waist lifted him into\nhis lap.\n\"One of my countrymen,\" he said to the girl beside him. He smiled while he\nspoke, but there was a queer feeling in his throat.\n",
        "989": "\"Don't you see the stars and stripes on my yacht?\" demanded Randall. Sure\nenough, the American colours hung limply under the nurse's arm.\n\"Oh,\" cried the girl, \"he is charming,\" and impulsively stooped to kiss\nhim, but the infant Randall wriggled out of Hastings' arms, and his nurse\npounced upon him with an angry glance at the girl.\n",
        "990": "She reddened and then bit her lips as the nurse, with eyes still fixed on\nher, dragged the child away and ostentatiously wiped his lips with her\nhandkerchief.\nThen she stole a look at Hastings and bit her lip again.\n\"What an ill-tempered woman!\" he said. \"In America, most nurses are\n",
        "991": "flattered when people kiss their children.\"\nFor an instant she tipped the parasol to hide her face, then closed it\nwith a snap and looked at him defiantly.\n\"Do you think it strange that she objected?\"\n",
        "992": "\"Why not?\" he said in surprise.\nAgain she looked at him with quick searching eyes.\nHis eyes were clear and bright, and he smiled back, repeating, \"Why not?\"\n",
        "993": "\"You _are_ droll,\" she murmured, bending her head.\n\"Why?\"\nBut she made no answer, and sat silent, tracing curves and circles in the\ndust with her parasol. After a while he said--\"I am glad to see that young\n",

        "999": "\"You must know, Monsieur Hastings, that we are all _un peu sans g\u00eane_ here\nin the Latin Quarter. We are very Bohemian, and etiquette and ceremony are\nout of place. It was for that Monsieur Clifford presented you to me with\nsmall ceremony, and left us together with less,--only for that, and I am\nhis friend, and I have many friends in the Latin Quarter, and we all know\neach other very well--and I am not studying art, but--but--\"\n\"But what?\" he said, bewildered.\n",
        "1000": "\"I shall not tell you,--it is a secret,\" she said with an uncertain smile.\nOn both cheeks a pink spot was burning, and her eyes were very bright.\nThen in a moment her face fell. \"Do you know Monsieur Clifford very\n",
        "1001": "intimately?\"\n\"Not very.\"\nAfter a while she turned to him, grave and a little pale.\n",
        "1002": "\"My name is Valentine--Valentine Tissot. Might--might I ask a service of\nyou on such very short acquaintance?\"\n\"Oh,\" he cried, \"I should be honoured.\"\n",
        "1003": "\"It is only this,\" she said gently, \"it is not much. Promise me not to\nspeak to Monsieur Clifford about me. Promise me that you will speak to no\none about me.\"\n",
        "1004": "\"I promise,\" he said, greatly puzzled.\nShe laughed nervously. \"I wish to remain a mystery. It is a caprice.\"\n\"But,\" he began, \"I had wished, I had hoped that you might give Monsieur\nClifford permission to bring me, to present me at your house.\"\n",
        "1005": "\"My--my house!\" she repeated.\n\"I mean, where you live, in fact, to present me to your family.\"\nThe change in the girl's face shocked him.\n",
        "1006": "\"I beg your pardon,\" he cried, \"I have hurt you.\"\nAnd as quick as a flash she understood him because she was a woman.\n\"My parents are dead,\" she said.\n",
        "1007": "Presently he began again, very gently.\n\"Would it displease you if I beg you to receive me? It is the custom?\"\n\"I cannot,\" she answered. Then glancing up at him, \"I am sorry; I should\n",
        "1008": "like to; but believe me. I cannot.\"\nHe bowed seriously and looked vaguely uneasy.\n\"It isn't because I don't wish to. I--I like you; you are very kind to\n",
        "1009": "me.\"\n\"Kind?\" he cried, surprised and puzzled.\n\"I like you,\" she said slowly, \"and we will see each other sometimes if\nyou will.\"\n",
        "1010": "\"At friends' houses.\"\n\"No, not at friends' houses.\"\n\"Where?\"\n",
        "1011": "\"Here,\" she said with defiant eyes.\n\"Why,\" he cried, \"in Paris you are much more liberal in your views than we\nare.\"\nShe looked at him curiously.\n",
        "1012": "\"Yes, we are very Bohemian.\"\n\"I think it is charming,\" he declared.\n\"You see, we shall be in the best of society,\" she ventured timidly, with\na pretty gesture toward the statues of the dead queens, ranged in stately\nranks above the terrace.\n",
        "1013": "He looked at her, delighted, and she brightened at the success of her\ninnocent little pleasantry.\n\"Indeed,\" she smiled, \"I shall be well chaperoned, because you see we are\nunder the protection of the gods themselves; look, there are Apollo, and\nJuno, and Venus, on their pedestals,\" counting them on her small gloved\nfingers, \"and Ceres, Hercules, and--but I can't make out--\"\nHastings turned to look up at the winged god under whose shadow they were\nseated.\n\"Why, it's Love,\" he said.\n",
        "1014": "IV\n\"There is a nouveau here,\" drawled Laffat, leaning around his easel and\naddressing his friend Bowles, \"there is a nouveau here who is so tender\nand green and appetizing that Heaven help him if he should fall into a\nsalad bowl.\"\n\"Hayseed?\" inquired Bowles, plastering in a background with a broken\npalette-knife and squinting at the effect with approval.\n",
        "1015": "\"Yes, Squeedunk or Oshkosh, and how he ever grew up among the daisies and\nescaped the cows, Heaven alone knows!\"\nBowles rubbed his thumb across the outlines of his study to \"throw in a\nlittle atmosphere,\" as he said, glared at the model, pulled at his pipe\nand finding it out struck a match on his neighbour's back to relight it.\n\"His name,\" continued Laffat, hurling a bit of bread at the hat-rack, \"his\nname is Hastings. He _is_ a berry. He knows no more about the world,\"--and\n",
        "1016": "here Mr. Laffat's face spoke volumes for his own knowledge of that\nplanet,--\"than a maiden cat on its first moonlight stroll.\"\nBowles now having succeeded in lighting his pipe, repeated the thumb touch\non the other edge of the study and said, \"Ah!\"\n",
        "1017": "\"Yes,\" continued his friend, \"and would you imagine it, he seems to think\nthat everything here goes on as it does in his d----d little backwoods\nranch at home; talks about the pretty girls who walk alone in the street;\nsays how sensible it is; and how French parents are misrepresented in\nAmerica; says that for his part he finds French girls,--and he confessed\nto only knowing one,--as jolly as American girls. I tried to set him\nright, tried to give him a pointer as to what sort of ladies walk about\nalone or with students, and he was either too stupid or too innocent to\ncatch on. Then I gave it to him straight, and he said I was a vile-minded\nfool and marched off.\"\n",
        "1018": "\"Did you assist him with your shoe?\" inquired Bowles, languidly\ninterested.\n\"Well, no.\"\n",
        "1019": "\"He called you a vile-minded fool.\"\n\"He was correct,\" said Clifford from his easel in front.\n\"What--what do you mean?\" demanded Laffat, turning red.\n",
        "1020": "\"_That_,\" replied Clifford.\n\"Who spoke to you? Is this your business?\" sneered Bowles, but nearly lost\nhis balance as Clifford swung about and eyed him.\n",
        "1021": "\"Yes,\" he said slowly, \"it's my business.\"\nNo one spoke for some time.\nThen Clifford sang out, \"I say, Hastings!\"\n",
        "1022": "And when Hastings left his easel and came around, he nodded toward the\nastonished Laffat.\n\"This man has been disagreeable to you, and I want to tell you that any\ntime you feel inclined to kick him, why, I will hold the other creature.\"\nHastings, embarrassed, said, \"Why no, I don't agree with his ideas,\nnothing more.\"\n",
        "1023": "Clifford said \"Naturally,\" and slipping his arm through Hastings',\nstrolled about with him, and introduced him to several of his own friends,\nat which all the nouveaux opened their eyes with envy, and the studio were\ngiven to understand that Hastings, although prepared to do menial work as\nthe latest nouveau, was already within the charmed circle of the old,\nrespected and feared, the truly great.\nThe rest finished, the model resumed his place, and work went on in a\nchorus of songs and yells and every ear-splitting noise which the art\nstudent utters when studying the beautiful.\nFive o'clock struck,--the model yawned, stretched and climbed into his\ntrousers, and the noisy contents of six studios crowded through the hall\nand down into the street. Ten minutes later, Hastings found himself on top\n",

        "1025": "\"By the way,\" said Hastings, \"how can I call on you when I don't know\nwhere you live?\"\n\"Why, I live opposite you.\"\n\"What--the studio in the garden where the almond trees are and the\nblackbirds--\"\n\"Exactly,\" said Clifford. \"I'm with my friend Elliott.\"\n",
        "1026": "Hastings thought of the description of the two American artists which he\nhad heard from Miss Susie Byng, and looked blank.\nClifford continued, \"Perhaps you had better let me know when you think of\ncoming so,--so that I will be sure to--to be there,\" he ended rather\nlamely.\n\"I shouldn't care to meet any of your model friends there,\" said Hastings,\nsmiling. \"You know--my ideas are rather straitlaced,--I suppose you would\n",
        "1027": "say, Puritanical. I shouldn't enjoy it and wouldn't know how to behave.\"\n\"Oh, I understand,\" said Clifford, but added with great cordiality,--\"I'm\nsure we'll be friends although you may not approve of me and my set, but\nyou will like Severn and Selby because--because, well, they are like\nyourself, old chap.\"\nAfter a moment he continued, \"There is something I want to speak about.\n",
        "1028": "You see, when I introduced you, last week, in the Luxembourg, to\nValentine--\"\n\"Not a word!\" cried Hastings, smiling; \"you must not tell me a word of\nher!\"\n\"Why--\"\n\"No--not a word!\" he said gaily. \"I insist,--promise me upon your honour\n",
        "1029": "you will not speak of her until I give you permission; promise!\"\n\"I promise,\" said Clifford, amazed.\n\"She is a charming girl,--we had such a delightful chat after you left,\nand I thank you for presenting me, but not another word about her until I\ngive you permission.\"\n",
        "1030": "\"Oh,\" murmured Clifford.\n\"Remember your promise,\" he smiled, as he turned into his gateway.\nClifford strolled across the street and, traversing the ivy-covered alley,\nentered his garden.\n",
        "1031": "He felt for his studio key, muttering, \"I wonder--I wonder,--but of course\nhe doesn't!\"\nHe entered the hallway, and fitting the key into the door, stood staring\nat the two cards tacked over the panels.\n  FOXHALL CLIFFORD\n  RICHARD OSBORNE ELLIOTT\n\"Why the devil doesn't he want me to speak of her?\"\n",

He's a brick.\"\n",
        "1034": "\"Yes,\" said Elliott, without enthusiasm.\n\"Don't you think so?\" demanded Clifford.\n\"Why yes, but he is going to have a tough time when some of his illusions\nare dispelled.\"\n",
        "1035": "\"More shame to those who dispel 'em!\"\n\"Yes,--wait until he comes to pay his call on us, unexpectedly, of\ncourse--\"\nClifford looked virtuous and lighted a cigar.\n\"I was just going to say,\" he observed, \"that I have asked him not to come\nwithout letting us know, so I can postpone any orgie you may have\nintended--\"\n\"Ah!\" cried Elliott indignantly, \"I suppose you put it to him in that\n",

        "1040": "\"Probably,\" replied the other.\n\"He's a trump!\" said Clifford, \"and if he swears the world is as good and\npure as his own heart, I'll swear he's right.\"\n",

        "1088": "\"Well,\" he said, greatly flattered, \"I'm afraid I couldn't amuse you--\"\n\"Oh, yes, you are funnier than the Eldorado.\"\n\"Now see here, don't guy me, Valentine. You always do, and, and,--you know\nwhat they say,--a good laugh kills--\"\n\"What?\"\n",
        "1089": "\"Er--er--love and all that.\"\nShe laughed until her eyes were moist with tears. \"Tiens,\" she cried, \"he\nis dead, then!\"\n",
        "1090": "Clifford eyed her with growing alarm.\n\"Do you know why I came?\" she said.\n\"No,\" he replied uneasily, \"I don't.\"\n",

        "1092": "He did not answer.\n\"Don't you know that I like you too well to--to ever fall in love with\nyou?\" she said. \"Don't you know that we are too good comrades,--too old\nfriends for that? And were we not,--do you think that I do not know your\n",

        "1094": "\"C\u00e9cile is tired of me.\"\n\"I hope she is,\" said the girl, \"for she deserves a better fate. Tiens, do\nyou know your reputation in the Quarter? Of the inconstant, the most\n",

        "1104": "The girl rose, very white. \"He is your friend--you have a right to warn\nhim.\"\n\"He is my friend,\" he said at length.\n",
        "1105": "They looked at each other in silence.\nThen she cried, \"By all that I hold to me most sacred, you need not warn\nhim!\"\n\"I shall trust your word,\" he said pleasantly.\n",
        "1106": "V\nThe month passed quickly for Hastings, and left few definite impressions\nafter it. It did leave some, however. One was a painful impression of\nmeeting Mr. Bladen on the Boulevard des Capucines in company with a very\npronounced young person whose laugh dismayed him, and when at last he\nescaped from the caf\u00e9 where Mr. Bladen had hauled him to join them in a\n",
        "1107": "_bock_ he felt as if the whole boulevard was looking at him, and judging\nhim by his company. Later, an instinctive conviction regarding the young\nperson with Mr. Bladen sent the hot blood into his cheek, and he returned\nto the pension in such a miserable state of mind that Miss Byng was\nalarmed and advised him to conquer his homesickness at once.\n",
        "1108": "Another impression was equally vivid. One Saturday morning, feeling\nlonely, his wanderings about the city brought him to the Gare St. Lazare.\nIt was early for breakfast, but he entered the H\u00f4tel Terminus and took a\ntable near the window. As he wheeled about to give his order, a man\n",
        "1109": "passing rapidly along the aisle collided with his head, and looking up to\nreceive the expected apology, he was met instead by a slap on the shoulder\nand a hearty, \"What the deuce are you doing here, old chap?\" It was\nRowden, who seized him and told him to come along. So, mildly protesting,\nhe was ushered into a private dining-room where Clifford, rather red,\njumped up from the table and welcomed him with a startled air which was\nsoftened by the unaffected glee of Rowden and the extreme courtesy of\nElliott. The latter presented him to three bewitching girls who welcomed\n",
        "1110": "him so charmingly and seconded Rowden in his demand that Hastings should\nmake one of the party, that he consented at once. While Elliott briefly\noutlined the projected excursion to La Roche, Hastings delightedly ate his\nomelet, and returned the smiles of encouragement from C\u00e9cile and Colette\nand Jacqueline. Meantime Clifford in a bland whisper was telling Rowden\nwhat an ass he was. Poor Rowden looked miserable until Elliott, divining\n",
        "1111": "how affairs were turning, frowned on Clifford and found a moment to let\nRowden know that they were all going to make the best of it.\n\"You shut up,\" he observed to Clifford, \"it's fate, and that settles it.\"\n\"It's Rowden, and that settles it,\" murmured Clifford, concealing a grin.\n",
        "1112": "For after all he was not Hastings' wet nurse. So it came about that the\ntrain which left the Gare St. Lazare at 9.15 a.m. stopped a moment in its\ncareer towards Havre and deposited at the red-roofed station of La Roche a\nmerry party, armed with sunshades, trout-rods, and one cane, carried by\nthe non-combatant, Hastings. Then, when they had established their camp in\n",
        "1113": "a grove of sycamores which bordered the little river Ept, Clifford, the\nacknowledged master of all that pertained to sportsmanship, took command.\n\"You, Rowden,\" he said, \"divide your flies with Elliott and keep an eye on\nhim or else he'll be trying to put on a float and sinker. Prevent him by\nforce from grubbing about for worms.\"\n",
        "1114": "Elliott protested, but was forced to smile in the general laugh.\n\"You make me ill,\" he asserted; \"do you think this is my first trout?\"\n\"I shall be delighted to see your first trout,\" said Clifford, and dodging\na fly hook, hurled with intent to hit, proceeded to sort and equip three\nslender rods destined to bring joy and fish to C\u00e9cil, Colette, and\nJacqueline. With perfect gravity he ornamented each line with four split\n",
        "1115": "shot, a small hook, and a brilliant quill float.\n\"_I_ shall never touch the worms,\" announced C\u00e9cile with a shudder.\nJacqueline and Colette hastened to sustain her, and Hastings pleasantly\noffered to act in the capacity of general baiter and taker-off of fish.\n",
        "1116": "But C\u00e9cile, doubtless fascinated by the gaudy flies in Clifford's book,\ndecided to accept lessons from him in the true art, and presently\ndisappeared up the Ept with Clifford in tow.\nElliott looked doubtfully at Colette.\n\"I prefer gudgeons,\" said that damsel with decision, \"and you and Monsieur\nRowden may go away when you please; may they not, Jacqueline?\"\n",
        "1117": "\"Certainly,\" responded Jacqueline.\nElliott, undecided, examined his rod and reel.\n\"You've got your reel on wrong side up,\" observed Rowden.\n",
        "1118": "Elliott wavered, and stole a glance at Colette.\n\"I--I--have almost decided to--er--not to flip the flies about just now,\"\nhe began. \"There's the pole that C\u00e9cile left--\"\n\"Don't call it a pole,\" corrected Rowden.\n",
        "1119": "\"_Rod_, then,\" continued Elliott, and started off in the wake of the two\ngirls, but was promptly collared by Rowden.\n\"No, you don't! Fancy a man fishing with a float and sinker when he has a\nfly rod in his hand! You come along!\"\n",
        "1120": "Where the placid little Ept flows down between its thickets to the Seine,\na grassy bank shadows the haunt of the gudgeon, and on this bank sat\nColette and Jacqueline and chattered and laughed and watched the swerving\nof the scarlet quills, while Hastings, his hat over his eyes, his head on\na bank of moss, listened to their soft voices and gallantly unhooked the\nsmall and indignant gudgeon when a flash of a rod and a half-suppressed\nscream announced a catch. The sunlight filtered through the leafy thickets\nawaking to song the forest birds. Magpies in spotless black and white\nflirted past, alighting near by with a hop and bound and twitch of the\ntail. Blue and white jays with rosy breasts shrieked through the trees,\n",
        "1121": "and a low-sailing hawk wheeled among the fields of ripening wheat, putting\nto flight flocks of twittering hedge birds.\nAcross the Seine a gull dropped on the water like a plume. The air was\npure and still. Scarcely a leaf moved. Sounds from a distant farm came\n",
        "1122": "faintly, the shrill cock-crow and dull baying. Now and then a steam-tug\nwith big raking smoke-pipe, bearing the name \"Gu\u00eape 27,\" ploughed up the\nriver dragging its interminable train of barges, or a sailboat dropped\ndown with the current toward sleepy Rouen.\nA faint fresh odour of earth and water hung in the air, and through the\nsunlight, orange-tipped butterflies danced above the marsh grass, soft\nvelvety butterflies flapped through the mossy woods.\n",
        "1123": "Hastings was thinking of Valentine. It was two o'clock when Elliott\nstrolled back, and frankly admitting that he had eluded Rowden, sat down\nbeside Colette and prepared to doze with satisfaction.\n\"Where are your trout?\" said Colette severely.\n",
        "1124": "\"They still live,\" murmured Elliott, and went fast asleep.\nRowden returned shortly after, and casting a scornful glance at the\nslumbering one, displayed three crimson-flecked trout.\n\"And that,\" smiled Hastings lazily, \"that is the holy end to which the\nfaithful plod,--the slaughter of these small fish with a bit of silk and\nfeather.\"\n",
        "1125": "Rowden disdained to answer him. Colette caught another gudgeon and awoke\nElliott, who protested and gazed about for the lunch baskets, as Clifford\nand C\u00e9cile came up demanding instant refreshment. C\u00e9cile's skirts were\nsoaked, and her gloves torn, but she was happy, and Clifford, dragging out\na two-pound trout, stood still to receive the applause of the company.\n",
        "1126": "\"Where the deuce did you get that?\" demanded Elliott.\nC\u00e9cile, wet and enthusiastic, recounted the battle, and then Clifford\neulogized her powers with the fly, and, in proof, produced from his creel\na defunct chub, which, he observed, just missed being a trout.\nThey were all very happy at luncheon, and Hastings was voted \"charming.\"\n",
        "1127": "He enjoyed it immensely,--only it seemed to him at moments that flirtation\nwent further in France than in Millbrook, Connecticut, and he thought that\nC\u00e9cile might be a little less enthusiastic about Clifford, that perhaps it\nwould be quite as well if Jacqueline sat further away from Rowden, and\nthat possibly Colette could have, for a moment at least, taken her eyes\nfrom Elliott's face. Still he enjoyed it--except when his thoughts drifted\nto Valentine, and then he felt that he was very far away from her. La\nRoche is at least an hour and a half from Paris. It is also true that he\n",
        "1128": "felt a happiness, a quick heart-beat when, at eight o'clock that night the\ntrain which bore them from La Roche rolled into the Gare St. Lazare and he\nwas once more in the city of Valentine.\n\"Good-night,\" they said, pressing around him. \"You must come with us next\n",
        "1129": "time!\"\nHe promised, and watched them, two by two, drift into the darkening city,\nand stood so long that, when again he raised his eyes, the vast Boulevard\nwas twinkling with gas-jets through which the electric lights stared like\nmoons.\nVI\nIt was with another quick heart-beat that he awoke next morning, for his\nfirst thought was of Valentine.\n",
        "1130": "The sun already gilded the towers of Notre Dame, the clatter of workmen's\nsabots awoke sharp echoes in the street below, and across the way a\nblackbird in a pink almond tree was going into an ecstasy of trills.\nHe determined to awake Clifford for a brisk walk in the country, hoping\nlater to beguile that gentleman into the American church for his soul's\nsake. He found Alfred the gimlet-eyed washing the asphalt walk which led\nto the studio.\n",
        "1131": "\"Monsieur Elliott?\" he replied to the perfunctory inquiry, \"_je ne sais\npas_.\"\n\"And Monsieur Clifford,\" began Hastings, somewhat astonished.\n",
        "1132": "\"Monsieur Clifford,\" said the concierge with fine irony, \"will be pleased\nto see you, as he retired early; in fact he has just come in.\"\nHastings hesitated while the concierge pronounced a fine eulogy on people\nwho never stayed out all night and then came battering at the lodge gate\nduring hours which even a gendarme held sacred to sleep. He also\ndiscoursed eloquently upon the beauties of temperance, and took an\nostentatious draught from the fountain in the court.\n",
        "1133": "\"I do not think I will come in,\" said Hastings.\n\"Pardon, monsieur,\" growled the concierge, \"perhaps it would be well to\nsee Monsieur Clifford. He possibly needs aid. Me he drives forth with\nhair-brushes and boots. It is a mercy if he has not set fire to something\n",
        "1134": "with his candle.\"\nHastings hesitated for an instant, but swallowing his dislike of such a\nmission, walked slowly through the ivy-covered alley and across the inner\ngarden to the studio. He knocked. Perfect silence. Then he knocked again,\nand this time something struck the door from within with a crash.\n",
        "1135": "\"That,\" said the concierge, \"was a boot.\" He fitted his duplicate key into\nthe lock and ushered Hastings in. Clifford, in disordered evening dress,\nsat on the rug in the middle of the room. He held in his hand a shoe, and\n",
        "1136": "did not appear astonished to see Hastings.\n\"Good-morning, do you use Pears' soap?\" he inquired with a vague wave of\nhis hand and a vaguer smile.\n",
        "1137": "Hastings' heart sank. \"For Heaven's sake,\" he said, \"Clifford, go to bed.\"\n\"Not while that--that Alfred pokes his shaggy head in here an' I have a\nshoe left.\"\nHastings blew out the candle, picked up Clifford's hat and cane, and said,\nwith an emotion he could not conceal, \"This is terrible,\nClifford,--I--never knew you did this sort of thing.\"\n",
        "1138": "\"Well, I do,\" said Clifford.\n\"Where is Elliott?\"\n\"Ole chap,\" returned Clifford, becoming maudlin, \"Providence which\nfeeds--feeds--er--sparrows an' that sort of thing watcheth over the\nintemperate wanderer--\"\n\"Where is Elliott?\"\n",
        "1139": "But Clifford only wagged his head and waved his arm about. \"He's out\nthere,--somewhere about.\" Then suddenly feeling a desire to see his\nmissing chum, lifted up his voice and howled for him.\n",
        "1140": "Hastings, thoroughly shocked, sat down on the lounge without a word.\nPresently, after shedding several scalding tears, Clifford brightened up\nand rose with great precaution.\n\"Ole chap,\" he observed, \"do you want to see er--er miracle? Well, here\n",
        "1141": "goes. I'm goin' to begin.\"\nHe paused, beaming at vacancy.\n\"Er miracle,\" he repeated.\n",
        "1142": "Hastings supposed he was alluding to the miracle of his keeping his\nbalance, and said nothing.\n\"I'm goin' to bed,\" he announced, \"poor ole Clifford's goin' to bed, an'\nthat's er miracle!\"\nAnd he did with a nice calculation of distance and equilibrium which would\nhave rung enthusiastic yells of applause from Elliott had he been there to\nassist _en connaisseur_. But he was not. He had not yet reached the\n",
        "1143": "studio. He was on his way, however, and smiled with magnificent\ncondescension on Hastings, who, half an hour later, found him reclining\nupon a bench in the Luxembourg. He permitted himself to be aroused, dusted\nand escorted to the gate. Here, however, he refused all further\n",
        "1144": "assistance, and bestowing a patronizing bow upon Hastings, steered a\ntolerably true course for the rue Vavin.\nHastings watched him out of sight, and then slowly retraced his steps\ntoward the fountain.

        "1145": "The air was fresh and sweet with perfume from the orange flowers.\nEverywhere pigeons were bathing, dashing the water over their iris-hued\nbreasts, flashing in and out of the spray or nestling almost to the neck\nalong the polished basin.

The bees were already busy among the\nheliotrope, and one or two grey flies with brick-coloured eyes sat in a\nspot of sunlight beside the marble seat, or chased each other about, only\nto return again to the spot of sunshine and rub their fore-legs, exulting.\n",
        "1147": "The sentries paced briskly before the painted boxes, pausing at times to\nlook toward the guard-house for their relief.\nThey came at last, with a shuffle of feet and click of bayonets, the word\nwas passed, the relief fell out, and away they went, crunch, crunch,\nacross the gravel.\nA mellow chime floated from the clock-tower of the palace, the deep bell\nof St. Sulpice echoed the stroke.

        "1151": "\"Did you really dream of,--of my being here?\"\n\"I think I was awake when I dreamed it,\" she admitted. Then for a time\nthey were mute, acknowledging by silence the happiness of being together.\n",
        "1152": "And after all their silence was eloquent, for faint smiles, and glances\nborn of their thoughts, crossed and recrossed, until lips moved and words\nwere formed, which seemed almost superfluous. What they said was not very\nprofound. Perhaps the most valuable jewel that fell from Hastings' lips\nbore direct reference to breakfast.\n",
        "1153": "\"I have not yet had my chocolate,\" she confessed, \"but what a material man\nyou are.\"\n\"Valentine,\" he said impulsively, \"I wish,--I do wish that you\nwould,--just for this once,--give me the whole day,--just for this once.\"\n\"Oh dear,\" she smiled, \"not only material, but selfish!\"\n",

        "1171": "\"What are you saying all to yourself?\" he said, but his voice was broken,\nand the wind whirled it back into his throat.\nShe heard him, and, turning from the window looked down at his arm about\nher. Then she raised her eyes to his. The car shook and the windows\n",

        "1173": "But he held her close and strong, whispering words of honest love and\npassion, and when she sobbed--\"Not that--not that--I have promised!

He leaned\n",
        "1174": "against the window, his ears swept by the furious wind, his heart in a\njoyous tumult. The forest was passed, and the sun slipped from behind the\ntrees, flooding the earth again with brightness. She raised her eyes and\nlooked out into the world from the window. Then she began to speak, but\n",
        "1175": "her voice was faint, and he bent his head close to hers and listened. \"I\ncannot turn from you; I am too weak. You were long ago my master--master\nof my heart and soul. I have broken my word to one who trusted me, but I\n",
        "1176": "have told you all;--what matters the rest?\" He smiled at her innocence and\nshe worshipped his. She spoke again: \"Take me or cast me away;--what\nmatters it? Now with a word you can kill me, and it might be easier to die\n",
        "1177": "than to look upon happiness as great as mine.\"\nHe took her in his arms, \"Hush, what are you saying? Look,--look out at\nthe sunlight, the meadows and the streams. We shall be very happy in so\n",

        "1179": "Trembling with happiness, she sighed: \"Is this the world? Then I have\nnever known it.\"\n\"Nor have I, God forgive me,\" he murmured.\n",

        "1182": "Selby, shy and nervous, walked over and began: \"My name is Selby,--I have\njust arrived in Paris, and bring a letter of introduction--\" His voice was\nlost in the crash of a falling easel, the owner of which promptly\nassaulted his neighbour, and for a time the noise of battle rolled through\nthe studios of MM. Boulanger and Lefebvre, presently subsiding into a\nscuffle on the stairs outside. Selby, apprehensive as to his own reception\nin the studio, looked at Clifford, who sat serenely watching the fight.\n",
        "1183": "\"It's a little noisy here,\" said Clifford, \"but you will like the fellows\nwhen you know them.\" His unaffected manner delighted Selby. Then with a\nsimplicity that won his heart, he presented him to half a dozen students\nof as many nationalities. Some were cordial, all were polite. Even the\nmajestic creature who held the position of Massier, unbent enough to say:\n\"My friend, when a man speaks French as well as you do, and is also a\nfriend of Monsieur Clifford, he will have no trouble in this studio. You\n",
        "1184": "expect, of course, to fill the stove until the next new man comes?\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"And you don't mind chaff?\"\n",
        "1185": "\"No,\" replied Selby, who hated it.\nClifford, much amused, put on his hat, saying, \"You must expect lots of it\nat first.\"\nSelby placed his own hat on his head and followed him to the door.\n",
        "1186": "As they passed the model stand there was a furious cry of \"Chapeau!\nChapeau!\" and a student sprang from his easel menacing Selby, who reddened\nbut looked at Clifford.\n",
        "1187": "\"Take off your hat for them,\" said the latter, laughing.\nA little embarrassed, he turned and saluted the studio.\n\"Et moi?\" cried the model.\n",
        "1188": "\"You are charming,\" replied Selby, astonished at his own audacity, but the\nstudio rose as one man, shouting: \"He has done well! he's all right!\"\nwhile the model, laughing, kissed her hand to him and cried: \"\u00c0 demain\nbeau jeune homme!\"\nAll that week Selby worked at the studio unmolested. The French students\n",
        "1189": "christened him \"l'Enfant Prodigue,\" which was freely translated, \"The\nProdigious Infant,\" \"The Kid,\" \"Kid Selby,\" and \"Kidby.\" But the disease\nsoon ran its course from \"Kidby\" to \"Kidney,\" and then naturally to\n\"Tidbits,\" where it was arrested by Clifford's authority and ultimately\nrelapsed to \"Kid.\"\nWednesday came, and with it M.

        "1190": "writhed under his biting sarcasms,--among the others Clifford, who was\ninformed that he knew even less about a work of art than he did about the\nart of work. Selby was more fortunate. The professor examined his drawing\nin silence, looked at him sharply, and passed on with a non-committal\ngesture. He presently departed arm in arm with Bouguereau, to the relief\nof Clifford, who was then at liberty to jam his hat on his head and\ndepart.\n",
        "1191": "The next day he did not appear, and Selby, who had counted on seeing him\nat the studio, a thing which he learned later it was vanity to count on,\nwandered back to the Latin Quarter alone.\nParis was still strange and new to him.

        "1195": "Turning to resume her course, she met Foxhall Clifford, and hurried on.\nClifford, open-mouthed, followed her with his eyes; then he looked after\nSelby, who had turned into the Boulevard St. Germain toward the rue de\nSeine.

Anyway, I can swear she never\nlooks at me, and goodness knows I have done all that respectful adoration\ncan do.\"\nHe sighed, and murmuring a prophecy concerning the salvation of his\nimmortal soul swung into that graceful lounge which at all times\ncharacterized Clifford. With no apparent exertion, he overtook Selby at\n",
        "1198": "the corner, and together they crossed the sunlit Boulevard and sat down\nunder the awning of the Caf\u00e9 du Cercle.

        "1200": "\"What's her name this time?\" asked Elliott, and Rowden answered promptly,\n\"Name, Yvette; nationality, Breton--\"\n\"Wrong,\" replied Clifford blandly, \"it's Rue Barr\u00e9e.\"\nThe subject changed instantly, and Selby listened in surprise to names\nwhich were new to him, and eulogies on the latest Prix de Rome winner.

        "1202": "answered chime on chime. With a glance at the sun, dipping low in the\ngolden dust behind the Palais Bourbon, they rose, and turning to the east,\ncrossed the Boulevard St. Germain and sauntered toward the \u00c9cole de\nM\u00e9decine. At the corner a girl passed them, walking hurriedly. Clifford\n",
        "1203": "smirked, Elliot and Rowden were agitated, but they all bowed, and, without\nraising her eyes, she returned their salute. But Selby, who had lagged\nbehind, fascinated by some gay shop window, looked up to meet two of the\nbluest eyes he had ever seen. The eyes were dropped in an instant, and the\nyoung fellow hastened to overtake the others.\n",
        "1204": "\"By Jove,\" he said, \"do you fellows know I have just seen the prettiest\ngirl--\" An exclamation broke from the trio, gloomy, foreboding, like the\nchorus in a Greek play.\n\"Rue Barr\u00e9e!\"\n\"What!\" cried Selby, bewildered.\n",
        "1205": "The only answer was a vague gesture from Clifford.\nTwo hours later, during dinner, Clifford turned to Selby and said, \"You\nwant to ask me something; I can tell by the way you fidget about.\"\n\"Yes, I do,\" he said, innocently enough; \"it's about that girl. Who is\n",

        "1210": "II\nTwenty-four hours later Selby had completely forgotten Rue Barr\u00e9e. During\nthe week he worked with might and main at the studio, and Saturday night\nfound him so tired that he went to bed before dinner and had a nightmare\nabout a river of yellow ochre in which he was drowning. Sunday morning,\napropos of nothing at all, he thought of Rue Barr\u00e9e, and ten seconds\nafterwards he saw her. It was at the flower-market on the marble bridge.\n",
        "1211": "She was examining a pot of pansies. The gardener had evidently thrown\nheart and soul into the transaction, but Rue Barr\u00e9e shook her head.\nIt is a question whether Selby would have stopped then and there to\ninspect a cabbage-rose had not Clifford unwound for him the yarn of the\nprevious Tuesday.

        "1216": "At first he was hardly conscious that he had stopped then he was scarcely\nconscious why he had stopped, then he thought he would move on, then he\nthought he wouldn't, then he looked at Rue Barr\u00e9e.\nThe gardener said, \"Mademoiselle, this is undoubtedly a fine pot of\npansies.\"\nRue Barr\u00e9e shook her head.\n",
        "1217": "The gardener smiled. She evidently did not want the pansies. She had\nbought many pots of pansies there, two or three every spring, and never\nargued. What did she want then?

        "1218": "about him.\n\"These tulips are magnificent,\" he observed, \"and these hyacinths--\" He\nfell into a trance at the mere sight of the scented thickets.\n\"That,\" murmured Rue, pointing to a splendid rose-bush with her furled\nparasol, but in spite of her, her voice trembled a little. Selby noticed\n",
        "1219": "it, more shame to him that he was listening, and the gardener noticed it,\nand, burying his nose in the roses, scented a bargain. Still, to do him\njustice, he did not add a centime to the honest value of the plant, for\nafter all, Rue was probably poor, and any one could see she was charming.\n\"Fifty francs, Mademoiselle.\"\n",
        "1220": "The gardener's tone was grave. Rue felt that argument would be wasted.\nThey both stood silent for a moment. The gardener did not eulogize his\nprize,--the rose-tree was gorgeous and any one could see it.\n",
        "1221": "\"I will take the pansies,\" said the girl, and drew two francs from a worn\npurse. Then she looked up. A tear-drop stood in the way refracting the\nlight like a diamond, but as it rolled into a little corner by her nose a\nvision of Selby replaced it, and when a brush of the handkerchief had\ncleared the startled blue eyes, Selby himself appeared, very much\nembarrassed. He instantly looked up into the sky, apparently devoured with\na thirst for astronomical research, and as he continued his investigations\nfor fully five minutes, the gardener looked up too, and so did a\npoliceman. Then Selby looked at the tips of his boots, the gardener looked\n",
        "1222": "at him and the policeman slouched on. Rue Barr\u00e9e had been gone some time.\n\"What,\" said the gardener, \"may I offer Monsieur?\"\nSelby never knew why, but he suddenly began to buy flowers. The gardener\n",
        "1223": "was electrified. Never before had he sold so many flowers, never at such\nsatisfying prices, and never, never with such absolute unanimity of\nopinion with a customer. But he missed the bargaining, the arguing, the\ncalling of Heaven to witness. The transaction lacked spice.\n",
        "1224": "\"These tulips are magnificent!\"\n\"They are!\" cried Selby warmly.\n\"But alas, they are dear.\"\n",
        "1225": "\"I will take them.\"\n\"Dieu!\" murmured the gardener in a perspiration, \"he's madder than most\nEnglishmen.\"\n",
        "1226": "\"This cactus--\"\n\"Is gorgeous!\"\n\"Alas--\"\n\"Send it with the rest.\"\nThe gardener braced himself against the river wall.\n",
        "1227": "\"That splendid rose-bush,\" he began faintly.\n\"That is a beauty. I believe it is fifty francs--\"\nHe stopped, very red. The gardener relished his confusion. Then a sudden\n",
        "1228": "cool self-possession took the place of his momentary confusion and he held\nthe gardener with his eye, and bullied him.\n\"I'll take that bush. Why did not the young lady buy it?\"\n\"Mademoiselle is not wealthy.\"\n",
        "1229": "\"How do you know?\"\n\"_Dame_, I sell her many pansies; pansies are not expensive.\"\n\"Those are the pansies she bought?\"\n",
        "1230": "\"These, Monsieur, the blue and gold.\"\n\"Then you intend to send them to her?\"\n\"At mid-day after the market.\"\n",
        "1231": "\"Take this rose-bush with them, and\"--here he glared at the\ngardener--\"don't you dare say from whom they came.\" The gardener's eyes\nwere like saucers, but Selby, calm and victorious, said: \"Send the others\nto the H\u00f4tel du S\u00e9nat, 7 rue de Tournon. I will leave directions with the\nconcierge.\"\n",
        "1232": "Then he buttoned his glove with much dignity and stalked off, but when\nwell around the corner and hidden from the gardener's view, the conviction\nthat he was an idiot came home to him in a furious blush. Ten minutes\nlater he sat in his room in the H\u00f4tel du S\u00e9nat repeating with an imbecile\nsmile: \"What an ass I am, what an ass!\"\nAn hour later found him in the same chair, in the same position, his hat\nand gloves still on, his stick in his hand, but he was silent, apparently\nlost in contemplation of his boot toes, and his smile was less imbecile\nand even a bit retrospective.\n",
        "1233": "III\nAbout five o'clock that afternoon, the little sad-eyed woman who fills the\nposition of concierge at the H\u00f4tel du S\u00e9nat held up her hands in amazement\nto see a wagon-load of flower-bearing shrubs draw up before the doorway.\nShe called Joseph, the intemperate gar\u00e7on, who, while calculating the\nvalue of the flowers in _petits verres_, gloomily disclaimed any knowledge\nas to their destination.\n\"_Voyons_,\" said the little concierge, \"_cherchons la femme_!\"\n",
        "1234": "\"You?\" he suggested.\nThe little woman stood a moment pensive and then sighed. Joseph caressed\nhis nose, a nose which for gaudiness could vie with any floral display.\n",
        "1235": "Then the gardener came in, hat in hand, and a few minutes later Selby\nstood in the middle of his room, his coat off, his shirt-sleeves rolled\nup. The chamber originally contained, besides the furniture, about two\nsquare feet of walking room, and now this was occupied by a cactus. The\nbed groaned under crates of pansies, lilies and heliotrope, the lounge was\ncovered with hyacinths and tulips, and the washstand supported a species\nof young tree warranted to bear flowers at some time or other.\n",
        "1236": "Clifford came in a little later, fell over a box of sweet peas, swore a\nlittle, apologized, and then, as the full splendour of the floral _f\u00eate_\nburst upon him, sat down in astonishment upon a geranium. The geranium was\na wreck, but Selby said, \"Don't mind,\" and glared at the cactus.\n\"Are you going to give a ball?\" demanded Clifford.\n",
        "1237": "\"N--no,--I'm very fond of flowers,\" said Selby, but the statement lacked\nenthusiasm.\n\"I should imagine so.\" Then, after a silence, \"That's a fine cactus.\"\nSelby contemplated the cactus, touched it with the air of a connoisseur,\nand pricked his thumb.\n",
        "1238": "Clifford poked a pansy with his stick. Then Joseph came in with the bill,\nannouncing the sum total in a loud voice, partly to impress Clifford,\npartly to intimidate Selby into disgorging a _pourboire_ which he would\nshare, if he chose, with the gardener. Clifford tried to pretend that he\nhad not heard, while Selby paid bill and tribute without a murmur. Then he\n",
        "1239": "lounged back into the room with an attempt at indifference which failed\nentirely when he tore his trousers on the cactus.\nClifford made some commonplace remark, lighted a cigarette and looked out\nof the window to give Selby a chance. Selby tried to take it, but getting\nas far as--\"Yes, spring is here at last,\" froze solid. He looked at the\n",
        "1240": "back of Clifford's head. It expressed volumes. Those little perked-up ears\nseemed tingling with suppressed glee. He made a desperate effort to master\nthe situation, and jumped up to reach for some Russian cigarettes as an\nincentive to conversation, but was foiled by the cactus, to whom again he\nfell a prey. The last straw was added.\n",
        "1241": "\"Damn the cactus.\" This observation was wrung from Selby against his\nwill,--against his own instinct of self-preservation, but the thorns on\nthe cactus were long and sharp, and at their repeated prick his pent-up\nwrath escaped. It was too late now; it was done, and Clifford had wheeled\naround.\n",
        "1242": "\"See here, Selby, why the deuce did you buy those flowers?\"\n\"I'm fond of them,\" said Selby.\n\"What are you going to do with them? You can't sleep here.\"\n",
        "1243": "\"I could, if you'd help me take the pansies off the bed.\"\n\"Where can you put them?\"\n\"Couldn't I give them to the concierge?\"\n",
        "1244": "As soon as he said it he regretted it. What in Heaven's name would\nClifford think of him! He had heard the amount of the bill. Would he\nbelieve that he had invested in these luxuries as a timid declaration to\nhis concierge? And would the Latin Quarter comment upon it in their own\n",
        "1245": "brutal fashion? He dreaded ridicule and he knew Clifford's reputation.\nThen somebody knocked.\nSelby looked at Clifford with a hunted expression which touched that young\nman's heart. It was a confession and at the same time a supplication.\n",
        "1246": "Clifford jumped up, threaded his way through the floral labyrinth, and\nputting an eye to the crack of the door, said, \"Who the devil is it?\"\nThis graceful style of reception is indigenous to the Quarter.\n\"It's Elliott,\" he said, looking back, \"and Rowden too, and their\nbulldogs.\" Then he addressed them through the crack.\n",
        "1247": "\"Sit down on the stairs; Selby and I are coming out directly.\"\nDiscretion is a virtue. The Latin Quarter possesses few, and discretion\nseldom figures on the list. They sat down and began to whistle.\n",
        "1248": "Presently Rowden called out, \"I smell flowers. They feast within!\"\n\"You ought to know Selby better than that,\" growled Clifford behind the\ndoor, while the other hurriedly exchanged his torn trousers for others.\n\"_We_ know Selby,\" said Elliott with emphasis.\n",
        "1249": "\"Yes,\" said Rowden, \"he gives receptions with floral decorations and\ninvites Clifford, while we sit on the stairs.\"\n\"Yes, while the youth and beauty of the Quarter revel,\" suggested Rowden;\nthen, with sudden misgiving; \"Is Odette there?\"\n\"See here,\" demanded Elliott, \"is Colette there?\"\n",
        "1250": "Then he raised his voice in a plaintive howl, \"Are you there, Colette,\nwhile I'm kicking my heels on these tiles?\"\n\"Clifford is capable of anything,\" said Rowden; \"his nature is soured\nsince Rue Barr\u00e9e sat on him.\"\nElliott raised his voice: \"I say, you fellows, we saw some flowers carried\ninto Rue Barr\u00e9e's house at noon.\"\n",

        "1254": "Three men who had not paid dues were caught and summoned. A fourth was\nscented, followed, outflanked, his retreat towards the door cut off, and\nfinally captured behind the stove. About that time, the revolution\nassuming an acute form, howls rose for \"Jules!\"\n",

Not that he was walking fast,--on\nthe contrary, he was strolling with that leisurely gait peculiar to\nhimself. Elliott was beside him and two bulldogs covered the rear. Elliott\n",
        "1261": "was reading the \"Gil Blas,\" from which he seemed to extract amusement, but\ndeeming boisterous mirth unsuitable to Clifford's state of mind, subdued\nhis amusement to a series of discreet smiles. The latter, moodily aware of\nthis, said nothing, but leading the way into the Luxembourg Gardens\ninstalled himself upon a bench by the northern terrace and surveyed the\nlandscape with disfavour. Elliott, according to the Luxembourg\nregulations, tied the two dogs and then, with an interrogative glance\ntoward his friend, resumed the \"Gil Blas\" and the discreet smiles.\n",
        "1262": "The day was perfect. The sun hung over Notre Dame, setting the city in a\nglitter. The tender foliage of the chestnuts cast a shadow over the\nterrace and flecked the paths and walks with tracery so blue that Clifford\nmight here have found encouragement for his violent \"impressions\" had he\nbut looked; but as usual in this period of his career, his thoughts were\nanywhere except in his profession. Around about, the sparrows quarrelled\n",

        "1264": "thought,--you are tagging after some new petticoat again. And,\" he\ncontinued wrathfully, \"if this is what you've kept me away from Julian's\nfor,--if it's to fill me up with the perfections of some little idiot--\"\n\"Not idiot,\" remonstrated Clifford gently.\n\"See here,\" cried Elliott, \"have you the nerve to try to tell me that you\nare in love again?\"\n",
        "1265": "\"Again?\"\n\"Yes, again and again and again and--by George have you?\"\n\"This,\" observed Clifford sadly, \"is serious.\"\n",
        "1266": "For a moment Elliott would have laid hands on him, then he laughed from\nsheer helplessness. \"Oh, go on, go on; let's see, there's Cl\u00e9mence and\nMarie Tellec and Cosette and Fifine, Colette, Marie Verdier--\"\n\"All of whom are charming, most charming, but I never was serious--\"\n\"So help me, Moses,\" said Elliott, solemnly, \"each and every one of those\nnamed have separately and in turn torn your heart with anguish and have\nalso made me lose my place at Julian's in this same manner; each and every\none, separately and in turn. Do you deny it?\"\n\"What you say may be founded on facts--in a way--but give me the credit of\nbeing faithful to one at a time--\"\n\"Until the next came along.\"\n",
        "1267": "\"But this,--this is really very different. Elliott, believe me, I am all\nbroken up.\"\nThen there being nothing else to do, Elliott gnashed his teeth and\nlistened.\n",
        "1268": "\"It's--it's Rue Barr\u00e9e.\"\n\"Well,\" observed Elliott, with scorn, \"if you are moping and moaning over\n_that_ girl,--the girl who has given you and myself every reason to wish\nthat the ground would open and engulf us,--well, go on!\"\n\"I'm going on,--I don't care; timidity has fled--\"\n\"Yes, your native timidity.\"\n",
        "1269": "\"I'm desperate, Elliott. Am I in love? Never, never did I feel so d--n\nmiserable. I can't sleep; honestly, I'm incapable of eating properly.\"\n\"Same symptoms noticed in the case of Colette.\"\n",
        "1270": "\"Listen, will you?\"\n\"Hold on a moment, I know the rest by heart. Now let me ask you something.\nIs it your belief that Rue Barr\u00e9e is a pure girl?\"\n",
        "1271": "\"Yes,\" said Clifford, turning red.\n\"Do you love her,--not as you dangle and tiptoe after every pretty\ninanity--I mean, do you honestly love her?\"\n\"Yes,\" said the other doggedly, \"I would--\"\n\"Hold on a moment; would you marry her?\"\n",
        "1272": "Clifford turned scarlet. \"Yes,\" he muttered.\n\"Pleasant news for your family,\" growled Elliott in suppressed fury.\n\"'Dear father, I have just married a charming grisette whom I'm sure\nyou'll welcome with open arms, in company with her mother, a most\nestimable and cleanly washlady.' Good heavens! This seems to have gone a\n",
        "1273": "little further than the rest. Thank your stars, young man, that my head is\nlevel enough for us both. Still, in this case, I have no fear. Rue Barr\u00e9e\nsat on your aspirations in a manner unmistakably final.\"\n",
        "1274": "\"Rue Barr\u00e9e,\" began Clifford, drawing himself up, but he suddenly ceased,\nfor there where the dappled sunlight glowed in spots of gold, along the\nsun-flecked path, tripped Rue Barr\u00e9e. Her gown was spotless, and her big\nstraw hat, tipped a little from the white forehead, threw a shadow across\nher eyes.\nElliott stood up and bowed. Clifford removed his head-covering with an air\n",
        "1275": "so plaintive, so appealing, so utterly humble that Rue Barr\u00e9e smiled.\nThe smile was delicious and when Clifford, incapable of sustaining himself\non his legs from sheer astonishment, toppled slightly, she smiled again in\nspite of herself. A few moments later she took a chair on the terrace and\ndrawing a book from her music-roll, turned the pages, found the place, and\nthen placing it open downwards in her lap, sighed a little, smiled a\nlittle, and looked out over the city. She had entirely forgotten Foxhall\n",
        "1276": "Clifford.\nAfter a while she took up her book again, but instead of reading began to\nadjust a rose in her corsage. The rose was big and red. It glowed like\nfire there over her heart, and like fire it warmed her heart, now\nfluttering under the silken petals. Rue Barr\u00e9e sighed again. She was very\n",
        "1277": "happy. The sky was so blue, the air so soft and perfumed, the sunshine so\ncaressing, and her heart sang within her, sang to the rose in her breast.\nThis is what it sang: \"Out of the throng of passers-by, out of the world\nof yesterday, out of the millions passing, one has turned aside to me.\"\n",
        "1278": "So her heart sang under his rose on her breast. Then two big\nmouse-coloured pigeons came whistling by and alighted on the terrace,\nwhere they bowed and strutted and bobbed and turned until Rue Barr\u00e9e\nlaughed in delight, and looking up beheld Clifford before her. His hat was\nin his hand and his face was wreathed in a series of appealing smiles\nwhich would have touched the heart of a Bengal tiger.\n",
        "1279": "For an instant Rue Barr\u00e9e frowned, then she looked curiously at Clifford,\nthen when she saw the resemblance between his bows and the bobbing\npigeons, in spite of herself, her lips parted in the most bewitching\nlaugh. Was this Rue Barr\u00e9e? So changed, so changed that she did not know\nherself; but oh! that song in her heart which drowned all else, which\ntrembled on her lips, struggling for utterance, which rippled forth in a\nlaugh at nothing,--at a strutting pigeon,--and Mr. Clifford.\n",
        "1280": "\"And you think, because I return the salute of the students in the\nQuarter, that you may be received in particular as a friend?

        "1281": "\"Let me only be permitted to speak to you now and then,--occasionally--very\noccasionally.\"\n\"And if _you_, why not another?\"\n\"Not at all,--I will be discretion itself.\"\n",
        "1282": "\"Discretion--why?\"\nHer eyes were very clear, and Clifford winced for a moment, but only for a\nmoment. Then the devil of recklessness seizing him, he sat down and\noffered himself, soul and body, goods and chattels. And all the time he\n",
        "1283": "knew he was a fool and that infatuation is not love, and that each word he\nuttered bound him in honour from which there was no escape. And all the\ntime Elliott was scowling down on the fountain plaza and savagely checking\nboth bulldogs from their desire to rush to Clifford's rescue,--for even\nthey felt there was something wrong, as Elliott stormed within himself and\ngrowled maledictions.\nWhen Clifford finished, he finished in a glow of excitement, but Rue\nBarr\u00e9e's response was long in coming and his ardour cooled while the\nsituation slowly assumed its just proportions. Then regret began to creep\n",

        "1286": "fair, in the sunshine of a perfect day. He followed her eyes.\n\"Oh,\" she murmured, \"it is hard,--hard to work always--always alone with\nnever a friend you can have in honour, and the love that is offered means\nthe streets, the boulevard--when passion is dead. I know it,--_we_ know\nit,--we others who have nothing,--have no one, and who give ourselves,\nunquestioning--when we love,--yes, unquestioning--heart and soul, knowing\nthe end.\"\n",
        "1287": "She touched the rose at her breast. For a moment she seemed to forget him,\nthen quietly--\"I thank you, I am very grateful.\" She opened the book and,\nplucking a petal from the rose, dropped it between the leaves. Then\n",
        "1288": "looking up she said gently, \"I cannot accept.\"\nV\nIt took Clifford a month to entirely recover, although at the end of the\nfirst week he was pronounced convalescent by Elliott, who was an\nauthority, and his convalescence was aided by the cordiality with which\nRue Barr\u00e9e acknowledged his solemn salutes. Forty times a day he blessed\nRue Barr\u00e9e for her refusal, and thanked his lucky stars, and at the same\ntime, oh, wondrous heart of ours!--he suffered the tortures of the\n",
        "1289": "blighted.\nElliott was annoyed, partly by Clifford's reticence, partly by the\nunexplainable thaw in the frigidity of Rue Barr\u00e9e.

        "1290": "But he never found out anything, and finally gave it up as beyond his\ncomprehension, merely qualifying Clifford as an idiot and reserving his\nopinion of Rue Barr\u00e9e. And all this time Selby was jealous. At first he\nrefused to acknowledge it to himself, and cut the studio for a day in the\ncountry, but the woods and fields of course aggravated his case, and the\nbrooks babbled of Rue Barr\u00e9e and the mowers calling to each other across\nthe meadow ended in a quavering \"Rue Bar-r\u00e9e-e!\" That day spent in the\ncountry made him angry for a week, and he worked sulkily at Julian's, all\nthe time tormented by a desire to know where Clifford was and what he\nmight be doing.

But the juleps spread balm on the sting\n",

The dinner was a success, or\n",

Later an idea struck him that it would save fatigue\nto take a cab, and he started back with that intention, but the cabs\nseemed already so far away and the lanterns were so bright and confusing\nthat he gave it up, and pulling himself together looked around.\n",
        "1300": "A shadow, a mass, huge, undefined, rose to his right. He recognized the\nArc de Triomphe and gravely shook his cane at it. Its size annoyed him. He\nfelt it was too big. Then he heard something fall clattering to the\n",
