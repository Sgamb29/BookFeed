        "2": "CHAPTER I. START IN LIFE\nI was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family,\nthough not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who\nsettled first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving\noff his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had married my\nmother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that\ncountry, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the\nusual corruption of words in England, we are now called\u2014nay we call\nourselves and write our name\u2014Crusoe; and so my companions always called\nme.\n",
        "3": "I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an\nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous\nColonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the\nSpaniards. What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than\nmy father or mother knew what became of me.\nBeing the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my head\nbegan to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who\n",
        "4": "was very ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as\nhouse-education and a country free school generally go, and designed me\nfor the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea;\nand my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay,\nthe commands of my father, and against all the entreaties and\npersuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be\nsomething fatal in that propensity of nature, tending directly to the\nlife of misery which was to befall me.\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel\nagainst what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into\nhis chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very\nwarmly with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons, more than a\n",
        "5": "mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving father\u2019s house and my\nnative country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of\nraising my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and\npleasure. He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or\nof aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon\nadventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in\nundertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were\nall either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the\nmiddle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life,\nwhich he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the\nworld, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries\nand hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of\nmankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy\nof the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the happiness\nof this state by this one thing\u2014viz. that this was the state of life\n",
        "6": "which all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the\nmiserable consequence of being born to great things, and wished they\nhad been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and\nthe great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the\nstandard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor\nriches.\nHe bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities of\nlife were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but that\nthe middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so\nmany vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they\nwere not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of\nbody or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and\nextravagances on the one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries,\nand mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon\nthemselves by the natural consequences of their way of living; that the\nmiddle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all\nkind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a\nmiddle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health,\nsociety, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were\nthe blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way men\nwent silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of\nit, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head, not\nsold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed\ncircumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest, nor\nenraged with the passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of\nambition for great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently\nthrough the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without\nthe bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day\u2019s\nexperience to know it more sensibly.\nAfter this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate\nmanner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into\nmiseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to\nhave provided against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my\nbread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly\ninto the station of life which he had just been recommending to me; and\nthat if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere\nfate or fault that must hinder it; and that he should have nothing to\nanswer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against\nmeasures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word, that as he would\ndo very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he\ndirected, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to\ngive me any encouragement to go away; and to close all, he told me I\nhad my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same\nearnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars,\nbut could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the\narmy, where he was killed; and though he said he would not cease to\npray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this\nfoolish step, God would not bless me, and I should have leisure\nhereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might\nbe none to assist in my recovery.\n",
        "7": "I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly\nprophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so\nhimself\u2014I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully,\nespecially when he spoke of my brother who was killed: and that when he\nspoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so\nmoved that he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was so\nfull he could say no more to me.\nI was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed, who could be\notherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to\nsettle at home according to my father\u2019s desire. But alas! a few days\n",
        "8": "wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of my father\u2019s further\nimportunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from\nhim. However, I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my\nresolution prompted; but I took my mother at a time when I thought her\na little more pleasant than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts\nwere so entirely bent upon seeing the world that I should never settle\nto anything with resolution enough to go through with it, and my father\nhad better give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I\nwas now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a\ntrade or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never\nserve out my time, but I should certainly run away from my master\nbefore my time was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my\nfather to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did\nnot like it, I would go no more; and I would promise, by a double\ndiligence, to recover the time that I had lost.\nThis put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it would\nbe to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that he\nknew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so\nmuch for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such\nthing after the discourse I had had with my father, and such kind and\ntender expressions as she knew my father had used to me; and that, in\nshort, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I might\ndepend I should never have their consent to it; that for her part she\nwould not have so much hand in my destruction; and I should never have\nit to say that my mother was willing when my father was not.\n",
        "9": "Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard\nafterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my\nfather, after showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh,\n\u201cThat boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes\nabroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can\ngive no consent to it.\u201d\nIt was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though, in\nthe meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling\nto business, and frequently expostulated with my father and mother\nabout their being so positively determined against what they knew my\ninclinations prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, where I went\ncasually, and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time;\nbut, I say, being there, and one of my companions being about to sail\nto London in his father\u2019s ship, and prompting me to go with them with\nthe common allurement of seafaring men, that it should cost me nothing\nfor my passage, I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so\nmuch as sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they\nmight, without asking God\u2019s blessing or my father\u2019s, without any\nconsideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God\nknows, on the 1st of September 1651, I went on board a ship bound for\nLondon. Never any young adventurer\u2019s misfortunes, I believe, began\n",
        "10": "sooner, or continued longer than mine. The ship was no sooner out of\nthe Humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most\nfrightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was most\ninexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind. I began now seriously\nto reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the\njudgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my father\u2019s house, and\nabandoning my duty. All the good counsels of my parents, my father\u2019s\n",
        "11": "tears and my mother\u2019s entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and my\nconscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it\nhas since, reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the breach of\nmy duty to God and my father.\nAll this while the storm increased, and the sea went very high, though\nnothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor what I saw a\nfew days after; but it was enough to affect me then, who was but a\nyoung sailor, and had never known anything of the matter. I expected\nevery wave would have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship\nfell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we\nshould never rise more; in this agony of mind, I made many vows and\nresolutions that if it would please God to spare my life in this one\nvoyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I would go\ndirectly home to my father, and never set it into a ship again while I\nlived; that I would take his advice, and never run myself into such\nmiseries as these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of his\n",

I found, indeed, some intervals of\nreflection; and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to\nreturn again sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused myself from\nthem as it were from a distemper, and applying myself to drinking and\ncompany, soon mastered the return of those fits\u2014for so I called them;\nand I had in five or six days got as complete a victory over conscience\nas any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could\ndesire. But I was to have another trial for it still; and Providence,\nas in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely\nwithout excuse; for if I would not take this for a deliverance, the\nnext was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened wretch among\nus would confess both the danger and the mercy of.\n",
        "16": "The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind\nhaving been contrary and the weather calm, we had made but little way\nsince the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we\nlay, the wind continuing contrary\u2014viz. at south-west\u2014for seven or eight\ndays, during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into the\nsame Roads, as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind\nfor the river.\n",
        "17": "We had not, however, rid here so long but we should have tided it up\nthe river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and after we had lain four\nor five days, blew very hard. However, the Roads being reckoned as good\nas a harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong,\nour men were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger,\nbut spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but\nthe eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased, and we had all\nhands at work to strike our topmasts, and make everything snug and\nclose, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea\nwent very high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several\nseas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come home; upon which\nour master ordered out the sheet-anchor, so that we rode with two\nanchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the bitter end.\n",
        "18": "By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I began to see\nterror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves. The\nmaster, though vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as\nhe went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him softly to\nhimself say, several times, \u201cLord be merciful to us! we shall be all\nlost! we shall be all undone!\u201d and the like. During these first hurries\n",
        "19": "I was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and\ncannot describe my temper: I could ill resume the first penitence which\nI had so apparently trampled upon and hardened myself against: I\nthought the bitterness of death had been past, and that this would be\nnothing like the first; but when the master himself came by me, as I\nsaid just now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully\nfrighted. I got up out of my cabin and looked out; but such a dismal\nsight I never saw: the sea ran mountains high, and broke upon us every\nthree or four minutes; when I could look about, I could see nothing but\ndistress round us; two ships that rode near us, we found, had cut their\nmasts by the board, being deep laden; and our men cried out that a ship\nwhich rode about a mile ahead of us was foundered. Two more ships,\nbeing driven from their anchors, were run out of the Roads to sea, at\nall adventures, and that with not a mast standing. The light ships\n",

But if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had about\n",
        "21": "me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of\nmy former convictions, and the having returned from them to the\nresolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself;\nand these, added to the terror of the storm, put me into such a\ncondition that I can by no words describe it. But the worst was not\ncome yet; the storm continued with such fury that the seamen themselves\nacknowledged they had never seen a worse.

In the middle of the night, and under all\nthe rest of our distresses, one of the men that had been down to see\ncried out we had sprung a leak; another said there was four feet water\nin the hold.

While this was doing the master, seeing some light\ncolliers, who, not able to ride out the storm were obliged to slip and\nrun away to sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a\nsignal of distress. I, who knew nothing what they meant, thought the\n",

        "25": "We worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent\nthat the ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate a\nlittle, yet it was not possible she could swim till we might run into\nany port; so the master continued firing guns for help; and a light\nship, who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help\nus. It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was\nimpossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the\nship\u2019s side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing\ntheir lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern with\na buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length, which they, after\nmuch labour and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under\nour stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them\nor us, after we were in the boat, to think of reaching their own ship;\nso all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore\nas much as we could; and our master promised them, that if the boat was\nstaved upon shore, he would make it good to their master: so partly\nrowing and partly driving, our boat went away to the northward, sloping\ntowards the shore almost as far as Winterton Ness.\n",

I walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to\nher; but found a neck or inlet of water between me and the boat which\nwas about half a mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more\nintent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my\npresent subsistence.\nA little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed so\nfar out that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship.

This forced\ntears to my eyes again; but as there was little relief in that, I\nresolved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my\nclothes\u2014for the weather was hot to extremity\u2014and took the water.

Here I found that the ship was\nbulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold, but that she lay so\non the side of a bank of hard sand, or, rather earth, that her stern\nlay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, almost to the water. By\nthis means all her quarter was free, and all that was in that part was\ndry; for you may be sure my first work was to search, and to see what\nwas spoiled and what was free.

I presented my gun at her, but, as she did not\nunderstand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer\nto stir away; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by the\nway, I was not very free of it, for my store was not great: however, I\nspared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled at it, and ate it,\nand looked (as if pleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could spare\nno more: so she marched off.\nHaving got my second cargo on shore\u2014though I was fain to open the\nbarrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they were too heavy,\nbeing large casks\u2014I went to work to make me a little tent with the sail\nand some poles which I cut for that purpose: and into this tent I\nbrought everything that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun; and\nI piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent,\nto fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.\n",
        "140": "When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with some\nboards within, and an empty chest set up on end without; and spreading\none of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head,\nand my gun at length by me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept\nvery quietly all night, for I was very weary and heavy; for the night\nbefore I had slept little, and had laboured very hard all day to fetch\nall those things from the ship, and to get them on shore.\nI had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I\nbelieve, for one man: but I was not satisfied still, for while the ship\nsat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to get everything out of\nher that I could; so every day at low water I went on board, and\nbrought away something or other; but particularly the third time I went\nI brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small\nropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, which\nwas to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder.\nIn a word, I brought away all the sails, first and last; only that I\nwas fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could,\nfor they were no more useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only.\n",
        "141": "But that which comforted me more still, was, that last of all, after I\nhad made five or six such voyages as these, and thought I had nothing\nmore to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with\u2014I say,\nafter all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, three large runlets\nof rum, or spirits, a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour; this\nwas surprising to me, because I had given over expecting any more\nprovisions, except what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the\nhogshead of the bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces\nof the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word, I got all this safe on\nshore also.\nThe next day I made another voyage, and now, having plundered the ship\nof what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the cables.\n",
        "142": "Cutting the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I got two\ncables and a hawser on shore, with all the ironwork I could get; and\nhaving cut down the spritsail-yard, and the mizzen-yard, and everything\nI could, to make a large raft, I loaded it with all these heavy goods,\nand came away. But my good luck began now to leave me; for this raft\nwas so unwieldy, and so overladen, that, after I had entered the little\ncove where I had landed the rest of my goods, not being able to guide\nit so handily as I did the other, it overset, and threw me and all my\ncargo into the water. As for myself, it was no great harm, for I was\nnear the shore; but as to my cargo, it was a great part of it lost,\nespecially the iron, which I expected would have been of great use to\nme; however, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of the\ncable ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite labour; for I\nwas fain to dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued me very\nmuch. After this, I went every day on board, and brought away what I\n",
        "143": "could get.\nI had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven times on\nboard the ship, in which time I had brought away all that one pair of\nhands could well be supposed capable to bring; though I believe verily,\nhad the calm weather held, I should have brought away the whole ship,\npiece by piece. But preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found\nthe wind began to rise: however, at low water I went on board, and\nthough I thought I had rummaged the cabin so effectually that nothing\nmore could be found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in\none of which I found two or three razors, and one pair of large\nscissors, with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks: in another\nI found about thirty-six pounds value in money\u2014some European coin, some\nBrazil, some pieces of eight, some gold, and some silver.\n",
        "144": "I smiled to myself at the sight of this money: \u201cO drug!\u201d said I, aloud,\n\u201cwhat art thou good for? Thou art not worth to me\u2014no, not the taking\noff the ground; one of those knives is worth all this heap; I have no\nmanner of use for thee\u2014e\u2019en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom\nas a creature whose life is not worth saving.\u201d However, upon second\n",
        "145": "thoughts I took it away; and wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I\nbegan to think of making another raft; but while I was preparing this,\nI found the sky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter\nof an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently occurred\nto me that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind\noffshore; and that it was my business to be gone before the tide of\nflood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all.\nAccordingly, I let myself down into the water, and swam across the\nchannel, which lay between the ship and the sands, and even that with\ndifficulty enough, partly with the weight of the things I had about me,\nand partly the roughness of the water; for the wind rose very hastily,\nand before it was quite high water it blew a storm.\n",
        "146": "But I had got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all my wealth\nabout me, very secure. It blew very hard all night, and in the morning,\nwhen I looked out, behold, no more ship was to be seen! I was a little\nsurprised, but recovered myself with the satisfactory reflection that I\nhad lost no time, nor abated any diligence, to get everything out of\nher that could be useful to me; and that, indeed, there was little left\nin her that I was able to bring away, if I had had more time.\n",
        "147": "I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything out of\nher, except what might drive on shore from her wreck; as, indeed,\ndivers pieces of her afterwards did; but those things were of small use\nto me.\nMy thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against\neither savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in\nthe island; and I had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and\nwhat kind of dwelling to make\u2014whether I should make me a cave in the\nearth, or a tent upon the earth; and, in short, I resolved upon both;\nthe manner and description of which, it may not be improper to give an\naccount of.\nI soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settlement, because\nit was upon a low, moorish ground, near the sea, and I believed it\nwould not be wholesome, and more particularly because there was no\nfresh water near it; so I resolved to find a more healthy and more\nconvenient spot of ground.\n",
        "148": "I consulted several things in my situation, which I found would be\nproper for me: 1st, health and fresh water, I just now mentioned;\n2ndly, shelter from the heat of the sun; 3rdly, security from ravenous\ncreatures, whether man or beast; 4thly, a view to the sea, that if God\nsent any ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for my\ndeliverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my expectation\nyet.\nIn search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the\nside of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was steep\nas a house-side, so that nothing could come down upon me from the top.\nOn the one side of the rock there was a hollow place, worn a little way\nin, like the entrance or door of a cave but there was not really any\ncave or way into the rock at all.\n",
        "149": "On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved to\npitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred yards broad, and\nabout twice as long, and lay like a green before my door; and, at the\nend of it, descended irregularly every way down into the low ground by\nthe seaside. It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill; so that it was\nsheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun,\n",
        "150": "or thereabouts, which, in those countries, is near the setting.\nBefore I set up my tent I drew a half-circle before the hollow place,\nwhich took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and\ntwenty yards in its diameter from its beginning and ending.\nIn this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them\ninto the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end\nbeing out of the ground above five feet and a half, and sharpened on\nthe top. The two rows did not stand above six inches from one another.\n",
        "151": "Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, and laid\nthem in rows, one upon another, within the circle, between these two\nrows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside,\nleaning against them, about two feet and a half high, like a spur to a\npost; and this fence was so strong, that neither man nor beast could\nget into it or over it. This cost me a great deal of time and labour,\nespecially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and\ndrive them into the earth.\nThe entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door, but by a\nshort ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was in, I lifted\nover after me; and so I was completely fenced in and fortified, as I\nthought, from all the world, and consequently slept secure in the\nnight, which otherwise I could not have done; though, as it appeared\nafterwards, there was no need of all this caution from the enemies that\nI apprehended danger from.\n",
        "152": "Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all my\nriches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you have\nthe account above; and I made a large tent, which to preserve me from\nthe rains that in one part of the year are very violent there, I made\ndouble\u2014one smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it; and\ncovered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among\nthe sails.\nAnd now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had brought on\nshore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and belonged\nto the mate of the ship.\nInto this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything that would\nspoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the\nentrance, which till now I had left open, and so passed and repassed,\nas I said, by a short ladder.\n",
        "153": "When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and\nbringing all the earth and stones that I dug down out through my tent,\nI laid them up within my fence, in the nature of a terrace, so that it\nraised the ground within about a foot and a half; and thus I made me a\ncave, just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house.\nIt cost me much labour and many days before all these things were\nbrought to perfection; and therefore I must go back to some other\nthings which took up some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened,\nafter I had laid my scheme for the setting up my tent, and making the\ncave, that a storm of rain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden\nflash of lightning happened, and after that a great clap of thunder, as\nis naturally the effect of it. I was not so much surprised with the\n",
        "154": "lightning as I was with the thought which darted into my mind as swift\nas the lightning itself\u2014Oh, my powder! My very heart sank within me\nwhen I thought that, at one blast, all my powder might be destroyed; on\nwhich, not my defence only, but the providing my food, as I thought,\nentirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger,\nthough, had the powder took fire, I should never have known who had\nhurt me.\n",
        "155": "Such impression did this make upon me, that after the storm was over I\nlaid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, and applied myself\nto make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and to keep it a little\nand a little in a parcel, in the hope that, whatever might come, it\nmight not all take fire at once; and to keep it so apart that it should\nnot be possible to make one part fire another. I finished this work in\nabout a fortnight; and I think my powder, which in all was about two\nhundred and forty pounds weight, was divided in not less than a hundred\nparcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any\ndanger from that; so I placed it in my new cave, which, in my fancy, I\ncalled my kitchen; and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the\nrocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully where I\nlaid it.\n",
        "156": "In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out once at least\nevery day with my gun, as well to divert myself as to see if I could\nkill anything fit for food; and, as near as I could, to acquaint myself\nwith what the island produced. The first time I went out, I presently\ndiscovered that there were goats in the island, which was a great\nsatisfaction to me; but then it was attended with this misfortune to\nme\u2014viz. that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it\nwas the most difficult thing in the world to come at them; but I was\nnot discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and then shoot\none, as it soon happened; for after I had found their haunts a little,\nI laid wait in this manner for them: I observed if they saw me in the\nvalleys, though they were upon the rocks, they would run away, as in a\nterrible fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was\nupon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from whence I concluded\nthat, by the position of their optics, their sight was so directed\ndownward that they did not readily see objects that were above them; so\nafterwards I took this method\u2014I always climbed the rocks first, to get\nabove them, and then had frequently a fair mark.\n",
        "157": "The first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she-goat, which\nhad a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved me\nheartily; for when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by her,\ntill I came and took her up; and not only so, but when I carried the\nold one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my\nenclosure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms,\nand carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame; but it\nwould not eat; so I was forced to kill it and eat it myself. These two\nsupplied me with flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and saved my\nprovisions, my bread especially, as much as possibly I could.\nHaving now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary to\nprovide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn: and what I did for\nthat, and also how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I made, I\nshall give a full account of in its place; but I must now give some\nlittle account of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which, it\nmay well be supposed, were not a few.\n",
        "158": "I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not cast away\nupon that island without being driven, as is said, by a violent storm,\nquite out of the course of our intended voyage, and a great way, viz.\nsome hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary course of the trade of\nmankind, I had great reason to consider it as a determination of\nHeaven, that in this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I\nshould end my life. The tears would run plentifully down my face when I\nmade these reflections; and sometimes I would expostulate with myself\nwhy Providence should thus completely ruin His creatures, and render\nthem so absolutely miserable; so without help, abandoned, so entirely\ndepressed, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a\nlife.\n",
        "159": "But something always returned swift upon me to check these thoughts,\nand to reprove me; and particularly one day, walking with my gun in my\nhand by the seaside, I was very pensive upon the subject of my present\ncondition, when reason, as it were, expostulated with me the other way,\nthus: \u201cWell, you are in a desolate condition, it is true; but, pray\nremember, where are the rest of you? Did not you come, eleven of you in\nthe boat? Where are the ten? Why were they not saved, and you lost? Why\nwere you singled out? Is it better to be here or there?\u201d And then I\n",
        "160": "pointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered with the good that\nis in them, and with what worse attends them.\nThen it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for my\nsubsistence, and what would have been my case if it had not happened\n(which was a hundred thousand to one) that the ship floated from the\nplace where she first struck, and was driven so near to the shore that\nI had time to get all these things out of her; what would have been my\ncase, if I had been forced to have lived in the condition in which I at\nfirst came on shore, without necessaries of life, or necessaries to\nsupply and procure them? \u201cParticularly,\u201d said I, aloud (though to\n",
        "161": "myself), \u201cwhat should I have done without a gun, without ammunition,\nwithout any tools to make anything, or to work with, without clothes,\nbedding, a tent, or any manner of covering?\u201d and that now I had all\nthese to sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself\nin such a manner as to live without my gun, when my ammunition was\nspent: so that I had a tolerable view of subsisting, without any want,\nas long as I lived; for I considered from the beginning how I would\nprovide for the accidents that might happen, and for the time that was\nto come, even not only after my ammunition should be spent, but even\nafter my health and strength should decay.\nI confess I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition being\ndestroyed at one blast\u2014I mean my powder being blown up by lightning;\nand this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me, when it lightened\nand thundered, as I observed just now.\n",
        "162": "And now being about to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of\nsilent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before,\nI shall take it from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It\nwas by my account the 30th of September, when, in the manner as above\nsaid, I first set foot upon this horrid island; when the sun, being to\nus in its autumnal equinox, was almost over my head; for I reckoned\nmyself, by observation, to be in the latitude of nine degrees\ntwenty-two minutes north of the line.\nAfter I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into my\nthoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, and\npen and ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days; but to prevent\nthis, I cut with my knife upon a large post, in capital letters\u2014and\nmaking it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore where I first\nlanded\u2014\u201cI came on shore here on the 30th September 1659.\u201d\n",
        "163": "Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch with my\nknife, and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and every\nfirst day of the month as long again as that long one; and thus I kept\nmy calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.\nIn the next place, we are to observe that among the many things which I\nbrought out of the ship, in the several voyages which, as above\nmentioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value, but not at\nall less useful to me, which I omitted setting down before; as, in\nparticular, pens, ink, and paper, several parcels in the captain\u2019s,\nmate\u2019s, gunner\u2019s and carpenter\u2019s keeping; three or four compasses, some\nmathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of\nnavigation, all which I huddled together, whether I might want them or\nno; also, I found three very good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo\nfrom England, and which I had packed up among my things; some\nPortuguese books also; and among them two or three Popish prayer-books,\nand several other books, all which I carefully secured. And I must not\nforget that we had in the ship a dog and two cats, of whose eminent\nhistory I may have occasion to say something in its place; for I\ncarried both the cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the\nship of himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went on shore\nwith my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many years; I\nwanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any company that he could\nmake up to me; I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would not\ndo. As I observed before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and I husbanded\n",
        "164": "them to the utmost; and I shall show that while my ink lasted, I kept\nthings very exact, but after that was gone I could not, for I could not\nmake any ink by any means that I could devise.\nAnd this put me in mind that I wanted many things notwithstanding all\nthat I had amassed together; and of these, ink was one; as also a\nspade, pickaxe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins,\nand thread; as for linen, I soon learned to want that without much\ndifficulty.\nThis want of tools made every work I did go on heavily; and it was near\na whole year before I had entirely finished my little pale, or\nsurrounded my habitation. The piles, or stakes, which were as heavy as\n",
        "165": "I could well lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in the\nwoods, and more, by far, in bringing home; so that I spent sometimes\ntwo days in cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and a third\nday in driving it into the ground; for which purpose I got a heavy\npiece of wood at first, but at last bethought myself of one of the iron\ncrows; which, however, though I found it, made driving those posts or\npiles very laborious and tedious work.\nBut what need I have been concerned at the tediousness of anything I\nhad to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in? nor had I any other\nemployment, if that had been over, at least that I could foresee,\nexcept the ranging the island to seek for food, which I did, more or\nless, every day.\n",
        "166": "I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the circumstances I\nwas reduced to; and I drew up the state of my affairs in writing, not\nso much to leave them to any that were to come after me\u2014for I was\nlikely to have but few heirs\u2014as to deliver my thoughts from daily\nporing over them, and afflicting my mind; and as my reason began now to\nmaster my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could,\nand to set the good against the evil, that I might have something to\ndistinguish my case from worse; and I stated very impartially, like\ndebtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I\nsuffered, thus:\u2014\n_Evil_.\n_Good_.\nI am cast upon a horrible, desolate island, void of all hope of\nrecovery.\n",
        "167": "But I am alive; and not drowned, as all my ship\u2019s company were.\nI am singled out and separated, as it were, from all the world, to be\nmiserable.\nBut I am singled out, too, from all the ship\u2019s crew, to be spared from\ndeath; and He that miraculously saved me from death can deliver me from\nthis condition.\n",
        "168": "I am divided from mankind\u2014a solitaire; one banished from human society.\nBut I am not starved, and perishing on a barren place, affording no\nsustenance.\nI have no clothes to cover me.\n",
        "169": "But I am in a hot climate, where, if I had clothes, I could hardly wear\nthem.\nI am without any defence, or means to resist any violence of man or\nbeast.\nBut I am cast on an island where I see no wild beasts to hurt me, as I\nsaw on the coast of Africa; and what if I had been shipwrecked there?\n",
        "170": "I have no soul to speak to or relieve me.\nBut God wonderfully sent the ship in near enough to the shore, that I\nhave got out as many necessary things as will either supply my wants or\nenable me to supply myself, even as long as I live.\nUpon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony that there was scarce\nany condition in the world so miserable but there was something\nnegative or something positive to be thankful for in it; and let this\nstand as a direction from the experience of the most miserable of all\nconditions in this world: that we may always find in it something to\ncomfort ourselves from, and to set, in the description of good and\nevil, on the credit side of the account.\n",
        "171": "Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and given\nover looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship\u2014I say, giving\nover these things, I began to apply myself to arrange my way of living,\nand to make things as easy to me as I could.\nI have already described my habitation, which was a tent under the side\nof a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables: but I\nmight now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against\nit of turfs, about two feet thick on the outside; and after some time\n(I think it was a year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to\nthe rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such\nthings as I could get, to keep out the rain; which I found at some\ntimes of the year very violent.\nI have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, and\ninto the cave which I had made behind me. But I must observe, too, that\n",
        "172": "at first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay in no\norder, so they took up all my place; I had no room to turn myself: so I\nset myself to enlarge my cave, and work farther into the earth; for it\nwas a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed\non it: and so when I found I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I\nworked sideways, to the right hand, into the rock; and then, turning to\nthe right again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out on\nthe outside of my pale or fortification. This gave me not only egress\nand regress, as it was a back way to my tent and to my storehouse, but\ngave me room to store my goods.\nAnd now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things as I\nfound I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table; for without\nthese I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world; I\ncould not write or eat, or do several things, with so much pleasure\nwithout a table: so I went to work. And here I must needs observe, that\n",
        "173": "as reason is the substance and origin of the mathematics, so by stating\nand squaring everything by reason, and by making the most rational\njudgment of things, every man may be, in time, master of every mechanic\nart. I had never handled a tool in my life; and yet, in time, by\nlabour, application, and contrivance, I found at last that I wanted\nnothing but I could have made it, especially if I had had tools.\nHowever, I made abundance of things, even without tools; and some with\nno more tools than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made\nthat way before, and that with infinite labour. For example, if I\n",
        "174": "wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an\nedge before me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I\nbrought it to be thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze.\nIt is true, by this method I could make but one board out of a whole\ntree; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I had\nfor the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took me up to make\na plank or board: but my time or labour was little worth, and so it was\nas well employed one way as another.\nHowever, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in the\nfirst place; and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I\nbrought on my raft from the ship.

Be that, however, one way\nor the other, when I awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and\nmy spirits lively and cheerful; when I got up I was stronger than I was\nthe day before, and my stomach better, for I was hungry; and, in short,\nI had no fit the next day, but continued much altered for the better.\nThis was the 29th.\n",

I killed a sea-fowl or two, something\nlike a brandgoose, and brought them home, but was not very forward to\neat them; so I ate some more of the turtle\u2019s eggs, which were very\ngood. This evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me\ngood the day before\u2014the tobacco steeped in rum; only I did not take so\nmuch as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over\nthe smoke; however, I was not so well the next day, which was the first\nof July, as I hoped I should have been; for I had a little spice of the\ncold fit, but it was not much.\n",

But now I\n",

As for my solitary life, it was nothing. I did not\nso much as pray to be delivered from it or think of it; it was all of\nno consideration in comparison to this. And I add this part here, to\nhint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense\nof things, they will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing\nthan deliverance from affliction.\n",

AGRICULTURAL EXPERIENCE\n",
        "288": "I had now been in this unhappy island above ten months. All possibility\nof deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from me;\nand I firmly believe that no human shape had ever set foot upon that\nplace. Having now secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my\nmind, I had a great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the\nisland, and to see what other productions I might find, which I yet\nknew nothing of.\n",
        "289": "It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular\nsurvey of the island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I\nhinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found after I came about two\nmiles up, that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no\nmore than a little brook of running water, very fresh and good; but\nthis being the dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of\nit\u2014at least not enough to run in any stream, so as it could be\nperceived. On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant savannahs\n",
        "290": "or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on the rising\nparts of them, next to the higher grounds, where the water, as might be\nsupposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and\ngrowing to a great and very strong stalk. There were divers other\nplants, which I had no notion of or understanding about, that might,\nperhaps, have virtues of their own, which I could not find out. I\nsearched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that climate,\nmake their bread of, but I could find none. I saw large plants of\n",
        "291": "aloes, but did not understand them. I saw several sugar-canes, but\nwild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect. I contented myself with\nthese discoveries for this time, and came back, musing with myself what\ncourse I might take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the\nfruits or plants which I should discover, but could bring it to no\nconclusion; for, in short, I had made so little observation while I was\nin the Brazils, that I knew little of the plants in the field; at\nleast, very little that might serve to any purpose now in my distress.\n",
        "292": "The next day, the sixteenth, I went up the same way again; and after\ngoing something further than I had gone the day before, I found the\nbrook and the savannahs cease, and the country become more woody than\nbefore. In this part I found different fruits, and particularly I found\nmelons upon the ground, in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees.\nThe vines had spread, indeed, over the trees, and the clusters of\ngrapes were just now in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was a\n",
        "293": "surprising discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I was\nwarned by my experience to eat sparingly of them; remembering that when\nI was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several of our\nEnglishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and\nfevers. But I found an excellent use for these grapes; and that was, to\ncure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins\nare kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they were, wholesome and\nagreeable to eat when no grapes could be had.\nI spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habitation;\nwhich, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had lain from\nhome. In the night, I took my first contrivance, and got up in a tree,\n",
        "294": "where I slept well; and the next morning proceeded upon my discovery;\ntravelling nearly four miles, as I might judge by the length of the\nvalley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and\nnorth side of me. At the end of this march I came to an opening where\nthe country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring of fresh\nwater, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran the other\nway, that is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, so\nflourishing, everything being in a constant verdure or flourish of\nspring that it looked like a planted garden. I descended a little on\nthe side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a secret kind of\npleasure, though mixed with my other afflicting thoughts, to think that\nthis was all my own; that I was king and lord of all this country\nindefensibly, and had a right of possession; and if I could convey it,\nI might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in\nEngland. I saw here abundance of cocoa trees, orange, and lemon, and\n",
        "295": "citron trees; but all wild, and very few bearing any fruit, at least\nnot then. However, the green limes that I gathered were not only\npleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards\nwith water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing.\nI found now I had business enough to gather and carry home; and I\nresolved to lay up a store as well of grapes as limes and lemons, to\nfurnish myself for the wet season, which I knew was approaching. In\n",

Accordingly, having spent three days in this\njourney, I came home (so I must now call my tent and my cave); but\nbefore I got thither the grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruit\nand the weight of the juice having broken them and bruised them, they\nwere good for little or nothing; as to the limes, they were good, but I\ncould bring but a few.\nThe next day, being the nineteenth, I went back, having made me two\nsmall bags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised, when coming\nto my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered them,\nto find them all spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some\nhere, some there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded\n",
        "297": "there were some wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but\nwhat they were I knew not. However, as I found there was no laying them\nup on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they\nwould be destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed with their\nown weight, I took another course; for I gathered a large quantity of\nthe grapes, and hung upon the out-branches of the trees, that they\nmight cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I\ncarried as many back as I could well stand under.\nWhen I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great pleasure\nthe fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situation;\nthe security from storms on that side of the water, and the wood: and\nconcluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode which was by\nfar the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider\n",
        "298": "of removing my habitation, and looking out for a place equally safe as\nwhere now I was situate, if possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part\nof the island.\nThis thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it for\nsome time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me; but when I came\nto a nearer view of it, I considered that I was now by the seaside,\nwhere it was at least possible that something might happen to my\nadvantage, and, by the same ill fate that brought me hither might bring\nsome other unhappy wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce\nprobable that any such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself\namong the hills and woods in the centre of the island was to anticipate\nmy bondage, and to render such an affair not only improbable, but\nimpossible; and that therefore I ought not by any means to remove.\nHowever, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent much of my time\nthere for the whole of the remaining part of the month of July; and\nthough upon second thoughts, I resolved not to remove, yet I built me a\nlittle kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with a strong\nfence, being a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked and\nfilled between with brushwood; and here I lay very secure, sometimes\ntwo or three nights together; always going over it with a ladder; so\nthat I fancied now I had my country house and my sea-coast house; and\nthis work took me up to the beginning of August.\n",

The 3rd of August, I found the grapes I had hung\nup perfectly dried, and, indeed, were excellent good raisins of the\nsun; so I began to take them down from the trees, and it was very happy\nthat I did so, for the rains which followed would have spoiled them,\nand I had lost the best part of my winter food; for I had above two\nhundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and\n",

This was the more strange to me because, though I had\nkilled a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was\nquite a different kind from our European cats; but the young cats were\nthe same kind of house-breed as the old one; and both my cats being\nfemales, I thought it very strange.

In this\nconfinement, I began to be straitened for food: but venturing out\ntwice, I one day killed a goat; and the last day, which was the 26th,\nfound a very large tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food was\nregulated thus: I ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece of\nthe goat\u2019s flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled\u2014for, to my\ngreat misfortune, I had no vessel to boil or stew anything; and two or\nthree of the turtle\u2019s eggs for my supper.\n",

But I was not perfectly easy at lying so open; for, as I had\nmanaged myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure; whereas now I\nthought I lay exposed, and open for anything to come in upon me; and\nyet I could not perceive that there was any living thing to fear, the\nbiggest creature that I had yet seen upon the island being a goat.\n_Sept._ 30.\u2014I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my landing.

I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting\nit apart for religious exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with\nthe most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging\nHis righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Him to have mercy on me\nthrough Jesus Christ; and not having tasted the least refreshment for\ntwelve hours, even till the going down of the sun, I then ate a\nbiscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day\nas I began it.

It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not\none grain of what I sowed this time came to anything: for the dry\nmonths following, the earth having had no rain after the seed was sown,\nit had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all till\nthe wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been but\nnewly sown. Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined\nwas by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to make\nanother trial in, and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and\nsowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal\nequinox; and this having the rainy months of March and April to water\nit, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but having\npart of the seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had\nbut a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half\na peck of each kind.

These\nI set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and when they were fit for\nuse I carried them to my cave; and here, during the next season, I\nemployed myself in making, as well as I could, a great many baskets,\nboth to carry earth or to carry or lay up anything, as I had occasion;\nand though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them\nsufficiently serviceable for my purpose; thus, afterwards, I took care\nnever to be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made more,\nespecially strong, deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks,\nwhen I should come to have any quantity of it.\nHaving mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time about it,\nI bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two wants.

        "315": "my guess it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.\nI could not tell what part of the world this might be, otherwise than\nthat I knew it must be part of America, and, as I concluded by all my\nobservations, must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps was all\ninhabited by savages, where, if I had landed, I had been in a worse\ncondition than I was now; and therefore I acquiesced in the\ndispositions of Providence, which I began now to own and to believe\nordered everything for the best; I say I quieted my mind with this, and\nleft off afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of being there.\nBesides, after some thought upon this affair, I considered that if this\nland was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other, see\nsome vessel pass or repass one way or other; but if not, then it was\nthe savage coast between the Spanish country and Brazils, where are\nfound the worst of savages; for they are cannibals or men-eaters, and\nfail not to murder and devour all the human bodies that fall into their\nhands.\n",
        "316": "With these considerations, I walked very leisurely forward. I found\nthat side of the island where I now was much pleasanter than mine\u2014the\nopen or savannah fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, and full\nof very fine woods. I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have\ncaught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to\nspeak to me. I did, after some painstaking, catch a young parrot, for I\n",

But the accident\nthat followed, though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its\nplace.\nI was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in the low\n",
        "318": "grounds hares (as I thought them to be) and foxes; but they differed\ngreatly from all the other kinds I had met with, nor could I satisfy\nmyself to eat them, though I killed several. But I had no need to be\nventurous, for I had no want of food, and of that which was very good\ntoo, especially these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle, or\ntortoise, which added to my grapes, Leadenhall market could not have\nfurnished a table better than I, in proportion to the company; and\nthough my case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for\nthankfulness that I was not driven to any extremities for food, but had\nrather plenty, even to dainties.\n",
        "319": "I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a day, or\nthereabouts; but I took so many turns and re-turns to see what\ndiscoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the place where I\nresolved to sit down all night; and then I either reposed myself in a\ntree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes set upright in the\nground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature\ncould come at me without waking me.\nAs soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see that I had\ntaken up my lot on the worst side of the island, for here, indeed, the\nshore was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other side I\nhad found but three in a year and a half. Here was also an infinite\nnumber of fowls of many kinds, some which I had seen, and some which I\nhad not seen before, and many of them very good meat, but such as I\nknew not the names of, except those called penguins.\n",
        "320": "I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of my\npowder and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat if I\ncould, which I could better feed on; and though there were many goats\nhere, more than on my side the island, yet it was with much more\ndifficulty that I could come near them, the country being flat and\neven, and they saw me much sooner than when I was on the hills.\nI confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine; but\nyet I had not the least inclination to remove, for as I was fixed in my\nhabitation it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I was\nhere to be as it were upon a journey, and from home. However, I\ntravelled along the shore of the sea towards the east, I suppose about\ntwelve miles, and then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a\nmark, I concluded I would go home again, and that the next journey I\ntook should be on the other side of the island east from my dwelling,\nand so round till I came to my post again.\n",
        "321": "I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I could\neasily keep all the island so much in my view that I could not miss\nfinding my first dwelling by viewing the country; but I found myself\nmistaken, for being come about two or three miles, I found myself\ndescended into a very large valley, but so surrounded with hills, and\nthose hills covered with wood, that I could not see which was my way by\nany direction but that of the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very\nwell the position of the sun at that time of the day. It happened, to\nmy further misfortune, that the weather proved hazy for three or four\ndays while I was in the valley, and not being able to see the sun, I\nwandered about very uncomfortably, and at last was obliged to find the\nseaside, look for my post, and come back the same way I went: and then,\nby easy journeys, I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot,\nand my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things very heavy.\nIn this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon it; and\nI, running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it alive from\nthe dog. I had a great mind to bring it home if I could, for I had\n",

I made a collar for this little\ncreature, and with a string, which I made of some rope-yarn, which I\nalways carried about me, I led him along, though with some difficulty,\ntill I came to my bower, and there I enclosed him and left him, for I\nwas very impatient to be at home, from whence I had been absent above a\nmonth.\nI cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old\nhutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. This little wandering journey,\n",
        "323": "without settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my\nown house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me\ncompared to that; and it rendered everything about me so comfortable,\nthat I resolved I would never go a great way from it again while it\nshould be my lot to stay on the island.\nI reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my long\njourney; during which most of the time was taken up in the weighty\naffair of making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be a mere\ndomestic, and to be well acquainted with me. Then I began to think of\nthe poor kid which I had penned in within my little circle, and\nresolved to go and fetch it home, or give it some food; accordingly I\nwent, and found it where I left it, for indeed it could not get out,\nbut was almost starved for want of food.

I gave humble and hearty thanks that God had\nbeen pleased to discover to me that it was possible I might be more\nhappy in this solitary condition than I should have been in the liberty\nof society, and in all the pleasures of the world; that He could fully\nmake up to me the deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of\nhuman society, by His presence and the communications of His grace to\nmy soul; supporting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon His\nprovidence here, and hope for His eternal presence hereafter.\n",

In the midst of the\ngreatest composure of my mind, this would break out upon me like a\nstorm, and make me wring my hands and weep like a child. Sometimes it\n",

Also, it is to be\nconsidered, that in the middle of the day, when the sun was in the\nzenith, the violence of the heat was too great to stir out; so that\nabout four hours in the evening was all the time I could be supposed to\nwork in, with this exception, that sometimes I changed my hours of\nhunting and working, and went to work in the morning, and abroad with\nmy gun in the afternoon.\n",

Any one may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece\nof work; but labour and patience carried me through that, and many\nother things. I only observe this in particular, to show the reason why\n",
        "332": "so much of my time went away with so little work\u2014viz. that what might\nbe a little to be done with help and tools, was a vast labour and\nrequired a prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. But\nnotwithstanding this, with patience and labour I got through everything\nthat my circumstances made necessary to me to do, as will appear by\nwhat follows.\n",
        "333": "I was now, in the months of November and December, expecting my crop of\nbarley and rice. The ground I had manured and dug up for them was not\ngreat; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not above the quantity\nof half a peck, for I had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry\nseason. But now my crop promised very well, when on a sudden I found I\nwas in danger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which\nit was scarcely possible to keep from it; as, first, the goats, and\nwild creatures which I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the\nblade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so\nclose, that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk.\n",
        "334": "This I saw no remedy for but by making an enclosure about it with a\nhedge; which I did with a great deal of toil, and the more, because it\nrequired speed. However, as my arable land was but small, suited to my\ncrop, I got it totally well fenced in about three weeks\u2019 time; and\nshooting some of the creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it\nin the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand\nand bark all night long; so in a little time the enemies forsook the\nplace, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen\napace.\nBut as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in the blade, so\nthe birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the ear; for,\ngoing along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop\nsurrounded with fowls, of I know not how many sorts, who stood, as it\nwere, watching till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among them,\n",

I was so provoked, that I\ncould not have patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every\ngrain that they ate now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me in\nthe consequence; but coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed\nthree of them.

This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and\nabout the latter end of December, which was our second harvest of the\nyear, I reaped my corn.\n",

And yet here I was\n",

These things being added to my desire of having a good\nquantity for store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved not to\ntaste any of this crop but to preserve it all for seed against the next\nseason; and in the meantime to employ all my study and hours of working\nto accomplish this great work of providing myself with corn and bread.\nIt might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread.

This, therefore, was not my work, but an\nassistance to my work; for now, as I said, I had a great employment\nupon my hands, as follows: I had long studied to make, by some means or\nother, some earthen vessels, which, indeed, I wanted sorely, but knew\nnot where to come at them. However, considering the heat of the\nclimate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any clay, I might make\nsome pots that might, being dried in the sun, be hard enough and strong\nenough to bear handling, and to hold anything that was dry, and\nrequired to be kept so; and as this was necessary in the preparing\ncorn, meal, &c., which was the thing I was doing, I resolved to make\n",

It happened after some time, making a pretty large fire for cooking\nmy meat, when I went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a\nbroken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as\nhard as a stone, and red as a tile.

So, after a great deal of time lost in\nsearching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a\ngreat block of hard wood, which I found, indeed, much easier; and\ngetting one as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed\nit on the outside with my axe and hatchet, and then with the help of\nfire and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in\nBrazil make their canoes. After this, I made a great heavy pestle or\nbeater of the wood called the iron-wood; and this I prepared and laid\nby against I had my next crop of corn, which I proposed to myself to\ngrind, or rather pound into meal to make bread.\n",
        "352": "My next difficulty was to make a sieve or searce, to dress my meal, and\nto part it from the bran and the husk; without which I did not see it\npossible I could have any bread. This was a most difficult thing even\nto think on, for to be sure I had nothing like the necessary thing to\nmake it\u2014I mean fine thin canvas or stuff to searce the meal through.\nAnd here I was at a full stop for many months; nor did I really know\nwhat to do. Linen I had none left but what was mere rags; I had goat\u2019s\n",
        "353": "hair, but neither knew how to weave it or spin it; and had I known how,\nhere were no tools to work it with. All the remedy that I found for\nthis was, that at last I did remember I had, among the seamen\u2019s clothes\nwhich were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin;\nand with some pieces of these I made three small sieves proper enough\nfor the work; and thus I made shift for some years: how I did\nafterwards, I shall show in its place.\nThe baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how I should\nmake bread when I came to have corn; for first, I had no yeast. As to\n",
        "354": "that part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern myself\nmuch about it. But for an oven I was indeed in great pain. At length I\nfound out an experiment for that also, which was this: I made some\nearthen-vessels very broad but not deep, that is to say, about two feet\ndiameter, and not above nine inches deep. These I burned in the fire,\nas I had done the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I\nmade a great fire upon my hearth, which I had paved with some square\ntiles of my own baking and burning also; but I should not call them\nsquare.\n",
        "355": "When the firewood was burned pretty much into embers or live coals, I\ndrew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it all over, and\nthere I let them lie till the hearth was very hot. Then sweeping away\nall the embers, I set down my loaf or loaves, and whelming down the\nearthen pot upon them, drew the embers all round the outside of the\npot, to keep in and add to the heat; and thus as well as in the best\noven in the world, I baked my barley-loaves, and became in little time\na good pastrycook into the bargain; for I made myself several cakes and\npuddings of the rice; but I made no pies, neither had I anything to put\ninto them supposing I had, except the flesh either of fowls or goats.\nIt need not be wondered at if all these things took me up most part of\nthe third year of my abode here; for it is to be observed that in the\nintervals of these things I had my new harvest and husbandry to manage;\nfor I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it home as well as I\ncould, and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time\nto rub it out, for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to\nthrash it with.\n",
        "356": "And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted to build\nmy barns bigger; I wanted a place to lay it up in, for the increase of\nthe corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about twenty\nbushels, and of the rice as much or more; insomuch that now I resolved\nto begin to use it freely; for my bread had been quite gone a great\nwhile; also I resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient for me\na whole year, and to sow but once a year.\nUpon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and rice were\nmuch more than I could consume in a year; so I resolved to sow just the\nsame quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a\nquantity would fully provide me with bread, &c.\nAll the while these things were doing, you may be sure my thoughts ran\nmany times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the other\nside of the island; and I was not without secret wishes that I were on\nshore there, fancying that, seeing the mainland, and an inhabited\ncountry, I might find some way or other to convey myself further, and\nperhaps at last find some means of escape.\n",
        "357": "But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such an\nundertaking, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and\nperhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse than the lions\nand tigers of Africa: that if I once came in their power, I should run\na hazard of more than a thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of\nbeing eaten; for I had heard that the people of the Caribbean coast\nwere cannibals or man-eaters, and I knew by the latitude that I could\nnot be far from that shore. Then, supposing they were not cannibals,\nyet they might kill me, as many Europeans who had fallen into their\nhands had been served, even when they had been ten or twenty\ntogether\u2014much more I, that was but one, and could make little or no\ndefence; all these things, I say, which I ought to have considered\nwell; and did come into my thoughts afterwards, yet gave me no\napprehensions at first, and my head ran mightily upon the thought of\ngetting over to the shore.\nNow I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with shoulder-of-mutton\nsail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of\nAfrica; but this was in vain: then I thought I would go and look at our\nship\u2019s boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a great\nway, in the storm, when we were first cast away. She lay almost where\n",
        "358": "she did at first, but not quite; and was turned, by the force of the\nwaves and the winds, almost bottom upward, against a high ridge of\nbeachy, rough sand, but no water about her. If I had had hands to have\nrefitted her, and to have launched her into the water, the boat would\nhave done well enough, and I might have gone back into the Brazils with\nher easily enough; but I might have foreseen that I could no more turn\nher and set her upright upon her bottom than I could remove the island;\nhowever, I went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers, and brought\nthem to the boat resolving to try what I could do; suggesting to myself\nthat if I could but turn her down, I might repair the damage she had\nreceived, and she would be a very good boat, and I might go to sea in\nher very easily.\nI spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent,\nI think, three or four weeks about it; at last finding it impossible to\nheave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand,\nto undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood to\nthrust and guide it right in the fall.\n",
        "359": "But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to get\nunder it, much less to move it forward towards the water; so I was\nforced to give it over; and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the\nboat, my desire to venture over for the main increased, rather than\ndecreased, as the means for it seemed impossible.\nThis at length put me upon thinking whether it was not possible to make\nmyself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those climates\nmake, even without tools, or, as I might say, without hands, of the\ntrunk of a great tree. This I not only thought possible, but easy, and\npleased myself extremely with the thoughts of making it, and with my\nhaving much more convenience for it than any of the negroes or Indians;\nbut not at all considering the particular inconveniences which I lay\nunder more than the Indians did\u2014viz. want of hands to move it, when it\n",
        "360": "was made, into the water\u2014a difficulty much harder for me to surmount\nthan all the consequences of want of tools could be to them; for what\nwas it to me, if when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, and with\nmuch trouble cut it down, if I had been able with my tools to hew and\ndub the outside into the proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out\nthe inside to make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it\u2014if, after all\nthis, I must leave it just there where I found it, and not be able to\nlaunch it into the water?\nOne would have thought I could not have had the least reflection upon\nmy mind of my circumstances while I was making this boat, but I should\nhave immediately thought how I should get it into the sea; but my\nthoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the sea in it, that I never\nonce considered how I should get it off the land: and it was really, in\nits own nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-five miles of\nsea than about forty-five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it\nafloat in the water.\nI went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did\nwho had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the design,\n",
        "361": "without determining whether I was ever able to undertake it; not but\nthat the difficulty of launching my boat came often into my head; but I\nput a stop to my inquiries into it by this foolish answer which I gave\nmyself\u2014\u201cLet me first make it; I warrant I will find some way or other\nto get it along when it is done.\u201d\nThis was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my fancy\nprevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar-tree, and I question\nmuch whether Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the Temple\nof Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part\nnext the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of\ntwenty-two feet; after which it lessened for a while, and then parted\ninto branches. It was not without infinite labour that I felled this\n",
        "362": "tree; I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was\nfourteen more getting the branches and limbs and the vast spreading\nhead cut off, which I hacked and hewed through with axe and hatchet,\nand inexpressible labour; after this, it cost me a month to shape it\nand dub it to a proportion, and to something like the bottom of a boat,\nthat it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near three\nmonths more to clear the inside, and work it out so as to make an exact\nboat of it; this I did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet and\nchisel, and by the dint of hard labour, till I had brought it to be a\nvery handsome periagua, and big enough to have carried six-and-twenty\nmen, and consequently big enough to have carried me and all my cargo.\nWhen I had gone through this work I was extremely delighted with it.\n",
        "363": "The boat was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or periagua,\nthat was made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke it had cost,\nyou may be sure; and had I gotten it into the water, I make no\nquestion, but I should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most\nunlikely to be performed, that ever was undertaken.\nBut all my devices to get it into the water failed me; though they cost\nme infinite labour too. It lay about one hundred yards from the water,\n",
        "364": "and not more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards\nthe creek. Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig\ninto the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity: this I began,\nand it cost me a prodigious deal of pains (but who grudge pains who\nhave their deliverance in view?); but when this was worked through, and\nthis difficulty managed, it was still much the same, for I could no\nmore stir the canoe than I could the other boat. Then I measured the\n",
        "365": "distance of ground, and resolved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the\nwater up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down to the\nwater. Well, I began this work; and when I began to enter upon it, and\ncalculate how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be\nthrown out, I found that, by the number of hands I had, being none but\nmy own, it must have been ten or twelve years before I could have gone\nthrough with it; for the shore lay so high, that at the upper end it\nmust have been at least twenty feet deep; so at length, though with\ngreat reluctancy, I gave this attempt over also.\nThis grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the folly of\nbeginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly\nof our own strength to go through with it.\n",
        "366": "In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this place, and\nkept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much comfort as\never before; for, by a constant study and serious application to the\nWord of God, and by the assistance of His grace, I gained a different\nknowledge from what I had before. I entertained different notions of\nthings. I looked now upon the world as a thing remote, which I had\nnothing to do with, no expectations from, and, indeed, no desires\nabout: in a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever\nlikely to have, so I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it\nhereafter\u2014viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it; and\n",
        "367": "well might I say, as Father Abraham to Dives, \u201cBetween me and thee is a\ngreat gulf fixed.\u201d\nIn the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the world\nhere; I had neither the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, nor\nthe pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now\ncapable of enjoying; I was lord of the whole manor; or, if I pleased, I\nmight call myself king or emperor over the whole country which I had\npossession of: there were no rivals; I had no competitor, none to\ndispute sovereignty or command with me: I might have raised\nship-loadings of corn, but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow\nas I thought enough for my occasion. I had tortoise or turtle enough,\n",
        "368": "but now and then one was as much as I could put to any use: I had\ntimber enough to have built a fleet of ships; and I had grapes enough\nto have made wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that\nfleet when it had been built.\nBut all I could make use of was all that was valuable: I had enough to\neat and supply my wants, and what was all the rest to me? If I killed\nmore flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or vermin; if I sowed\nmore corn than I could eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut\ndown were lying to rot on the ground; I could make no more use of them\nbut for fuel, and that I had no occasion for but to dress my food.\n",
        "369": "In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upon\njust reflection, that all the good things of this world are no farther\ngood to us than they are for our use; and that, whatever we may heap up\nto give others, we enjoy just as much as we can use, and no more. The\nmost covetous, griping miser in the world would have been cured of the\nvice of covetousness if he had been in my case; for I possessed\ninfinitely more than I knew what to do with. I had no room for desire,\nexcept it was of things which I had not, and they were but trifles,\nthough, indeed, of great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel\n",
        "370": "of money, as well gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling.\nAlas! there the sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no more manner of\nbusiness for it; and often thought with myself that I would have given\na handful of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes; or for a hand-mill to\ngrind my corn; nay, I would have given it all for a sixpenny-worth of\nturnip and carrot seed out of England, or for a handful of peas and\nbeans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the least advantage by\n",

I\nfrequently sat down to meat with thankfulness, and admired the hand of\nGod\u2019s providence, which had thus spread my table in the wilderness. I\n",
        "372": "learned to look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less\nupon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed rather than what I\nwanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I cannot\nexpress them; and which I take notice of here, to put those\ndiscontented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what\nGod has given them, because they see and covet something that He has\nnot given them. All our discontents about what we want appeared to me\nto spring from the want of thankfulness for what we have.\nAnother reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would be so to\nany one that should fall into such distress as mine was; and this was,\nto compare my present condition with what I at first expected it would\nbe; nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good providence\nof God had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the\nshore, where I not only could come at her, but could bring what I got\nout of her to the shore, for my relief and comfort; without which, I\nhad wanted for tools to work, weapons for defence, and gunpowder and\nshot for getting my food.\n",
        "373": "I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to myself,\nin the most lively colours, how I must have acted if I had got nothing\nout of the ship.

In a\nword, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a life of\nmercy another; and I wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort but to\nbe able to make my sense of God\u2019s goodness to me, and care over me in\nthis condition, be my daily consolation; and after I did make a just\nimprovement on these things, I went away, and was no more sad.

This made my life better than sociable,\nfor when I began to regret the want of conversation I would ask myself,\nwhether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts, and (as I hope I\nmay say) with even God Himself, by ejaculations, was not better than\nthe utmost enjoyment of human society in the world?\n",
        "385": "CHAPTER X. TAMES GOATS\nI cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing\nhappened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the same posture\nand place, as before; the chief things I was employed in, besides my\nyearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of\nboth which I always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one\nyear\u2019s provisions beforehand; I say, besides this yearly labour, and my\ndaily pursuit of going out with my gun, I had one labour, to make a\ncanoe, which at last I finished: so that, by digging a canal to it of\nsix feet wide and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost\nhalf a mile. As for the first, which was so vastly big, for I made it\nwithout considering beforehand, as I ought to have done, how I should\nbe able to launch it, so, never being able to bring it into the water,\nor bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was as a\nmemorandum to teach me to be wiser the next time: indeed, the next\ntime, though I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a place\nwhere I could not get the water to it at any less distance than, as I\nhave said, near half a mile, yet, as I saw it was practicable at last,\nI never gave it over; and though I was near two years about it, yet I\nnever grudged my labour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at\nlast.\n",
        "386": "However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size of it was\nnot at all answerable to the design which I had in view when I made the\nfirst; I mean of venturing over to the _terra firma_, where it was\nabove forty miles broad; accordingly, the smallness of my boat assisted\nto put an end to that design, and now I thought no more of it. As I had\na boat, my next design was to make a cruise round the island; for as I\nhad been on the other side in one place, crossing, as I have already\ndescribed it, over the land, so the discoveries I made in that little\njourney made me very eager to see other parts of the coast; and now I\nhad a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the island.\nFor this purpose, that I might do everything with discretion and\nconsideration, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and made a sail\ntoo out of some of the pieces of the ship\u2019s sails which lay in store,\nand of which I had a great stock by me. Having fitted my mast and sail,\n",
        "387": "and tried the boat, I found she would sail very well; then I made\nlittle lockers or boxes at each end of my boat, to put provisions,\nnecessaries, ammunition, &c., into, to be kept dry, either from rain or\nthe spray of the sea; and a little, long, hollow place I cut in the\ninside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang\ndown over it to keep it dry.\nI fixed my umbrella also in the step at the stern, like a mast, to\nstand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an\nawning; and thus I every now and then took a little voyage upon the\nsea, but never went far out, nor far from the little creek. At last,\n",
        "388": "being eager to view the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved\nupon my cruise; and accordingly I victualled my ship for the voyage,\nputting in two dozen of loaves (cakes I should call them) of\nbarley-bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice (a food I ate a good\ndeal of), a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder and shot for\nkilling more, and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned\nbefore, I had saved out of the seamen\u2019s chests; these I took, one to\nlie upon, and the other to cover me in the night.\nIt was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign\u2014or my\ncaptivity, which you please\u2014that I set out on this voyage, and I found\nit much longer than I expected; for though the island itself was not\nvery large, yet when I came to the east side of it, I found a great\nledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above\nwater, some under it; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a\nleague more, so that I was obliged to go a great way out to sea to\ndouble the point.\nWhen I first discovered them, I was going to give over my enterprise,\nand come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out\nto sea; and above all, doubting how I should get back again: so I came\nto an anchor; for I had made a kind of an anchor with a piece of a\nbroken grappling which I got out of the ship.\n",
        "389": "Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, climbing up a\nhill, which seemed to overlook that point where I saw the full extent\nof it, and resolved to venture.\nIn my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perceived a\nstrong, and indeed a most furious current, which ran to the east, and\neven came close to the point; and I took the more notice of it because\nI saw there might be some danger that when I came into it I might be\ncarried out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to make the\nisland again; and indeed, had I not got first upon this hill, I believe\nit would have been so; for there was the same current on the other side\nthe island, only that it set off at a further distance, and I saw there\nwas a strong eddy under the shore; so I had nothing to do but to get\nout of the first current, and I should presently be in an eddy.\nI lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty fresh at\nESE., and that being just contrary to the current, made a great breach\n",
        "390": "of the sea upon the point: so that it was not safe for me to keep too\nclose to the shore for the breach, nor to go too far off, because of\nthe stream.\nThe third day, in the morning, the wind having abated overnight, the\nsea was calm, and I ventured: but I am a warning to all rash and\nignorant pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point, when I was not\neven my boat\u2019s length from the shore, but I found myself in a great\ndepth of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill; it carried my\nboat along with it with such violence that all I could do could not\nkeep her so much as on the edge of it; but I found it hurried me\nfarther and farther out from the eddy, which was on my left hand. There\nwas no wind stirring to help me, and all I could do with my paddles\nsignified nothing: and now I began to give myself over for lost; for as\nthe current was on both sides of the island, I knew in a few leagues\ndistance they must join again, and then I was irrecoverably gone; nor\ndid I see any possibility of avoiding it; so that I had no prospect\nbefore me but of perishing, not by the sea, for that was calm enough,\nbut of starving from hunger. I had, indeed, found a tortoise on the\n",
        "391": "shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into the boat;\nand I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen\npots; but what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where,\nto be sure, there was no shore, no mainland or island, for a thousand\nleagues at least?\nAnd now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make even\nthe most miserable condition of mankind worse. Now I looked back upon\nmy desolate, solitary island as the most pleasant place in the world\nand all the happiness my heart could wish for was to be but there\nagain. I stretched out my hands to it, with eager wishes\u2014\u201cO happy\n",
        "392": "desert!\u201d said I, \u201cI shall never see thee more. O miserable creature!\nwhither am going?\u201d Then I reproached myself with my unthankful temper,\nand that I had repined at my solitary condition; and now what would I\ngive to be on shore there again! Thus, we never see the true state of\n",
        "393": "our condition till it is illustrated to us by its contraries, nor know\nhow to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is scarcely\npossible to imagine the consternation I was now in, being driven from\nmy beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide\nocean, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever recovering\nit again. However, I worked hard till, indeed, my strength was almost\nexhausted, and kept my boat as much to the northward, that is, towards\nthe side of the current which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could;\nwhen about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a\nlittle breeze of wind in my face, springing up from SSE. This cheered\n",
        "394": "my heart a little, and especially when, in about half-an-hour more, it\nblew a pretty gentle gale. By this time I had got at a frightful\ndistance from the island, and had the least cloudy or hazy weather\nintervened, I had been undone another way, too; for I had no compass on\nboard, and should never have known how to have steered towards the\nisland, if I had but once lost sight of it; but the weather continuing\nclear, I applied myself to get up my mast again, and spread my sail,\nstanding away to the north as much as possible, to get out of the\ncurrent.\nJust as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch away,\nI saw even by the clearness of the water some alteration of the current\nwas near; for where the current was so strong the water was foul; but\nperceiving the water clear, I found the current abate; and presently I\nfound to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some\nrocks: these rocks I found caused the current to part again, and as the\nmain stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the\nnorth-east, so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made\na strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-west, with a very\nsharp stream.\n",
        "395": "They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon the\nladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or who\nhave been in such extremities, may guess what my present surprise of\njoy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy; and\nthe wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running\ncheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy underfoot.\nThis eddy carried me about a league on my way back again, directly\ntowards the island, but about two leagues more to the northward than\nthe current which carried me away at first; so that when I came near\nthe island, I found myself open to the northern shore of it, that is to\nsay, the other end of the island, opposite to that which I went out\nfrom.\nWhen I had made something more than a league of way by the help of this\ncurrent or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no further.\n",
        "396": "However, I found that being between two great currents\u2014viz. that on the\nsouth side, which had hurried me away, and that on the north, which lay\nabout a league on the other side; I say, between these two, in the wake\nof the island, I found the water at least still, and running no way;\nand having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering\ndirectly for the island, though not making such fresh way as I did\nbefore.\nAbout four o\u2019clock in the evening, being then within a league of the\nisland, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster\nstretching out, as is described before, to the southward, and casting\noff the current more southerly, had, of course, made another eddy to\nthe north; and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the\nway my course lay, which was due west, but almost full north. However,\n",
        "397": "having a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west;\nand in about an hour came within about a mile of the shore, where, it\nbeing smooth water, I soon got to land.\nWhen I was on shore, God I fell on my knees and gave God thanks for my\ndeliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by\nmy boat; and refreshing myself with such things as I had, I brought my\nboat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied under some\ntrees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the labour and\nfatigue of the voyage.\nI was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat! I had run\n",
        "398": "so much hazard, and knew too much of the case, to think of attempting\nit by the way I went out; and what might be at the other side (I mean\nthe west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures;\nso I resolved on the next morning to make my way westward along the\nshore, and to see if there was no creek where I might lay up my frigate\nin safety, so as to have her again if I wanted her. In about three\nmiles or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet\nor bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very little\nrivulet or brook, where I found a very convenient harbour for my boat,\nand where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on purpose\nfor her. Here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on\nshore to look about me, and see where I was.\n",
        "399": "I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had been\nbefore, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so taking nothing out\nof my boat but my gun and umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot, I began\nmy march. The way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had\nbeen upon, and I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found\neverything standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good order,\nbeing, as I said before, my country house.\nI got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my limbs,\nfor I was very weary, and fell asleep; but judge you, if you can, that\nread my story, what a surprise I must be in when I was awaked out of my\nsleep by a voice calling me by my name several times, \u201cRobin, Robin,\nRobin Crusoe: poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where are\n",
        "400": "you? Where have you been?\u201d\nI was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or part of\nthe day, and with walking the latter part, that I did not wake\nthoroughly; but dozing thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me; but\nas the voice continued to repeat, \u201cRobin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe,\u201d at last\nI began to wake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened,\nand started up in the utmost consternation; but no sooner were my eyes\nopen, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge; and\nimmediately knew that it was he that spoke to me; for just in such\nbemoaning language I had used to talk to him and teach him; and he had\nlearned it so perfectly that he would sit upon my finger, and lay his\nbill close to my face and cry, \u201cPoor Robin Crusoe! Where are you? Where\nhave you been? How came you here?\u201d and such things as I had taught him.\n",
        "401": "However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed it could\nbe nobody else, it was a good while before I could compose myself.\nFirst, I was amazed how the creature got thither; and then, how he\nshould just keep about the place, and nowhere else; but as I was well\nsatisfied it could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over it; and\nholding out my hand, and calling him by his name, \u201cPoll,\u201d the sociable\ncreature came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and\ncontinued talking to me, \u201cPoor Robin Crusoe! and how did I come here?\nand where had I been?\u201d just as if he had been overjoyed to see me\n",
        "402": "again; and so I carried him home along with me.\nI had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enough\nto do for many days to sit still and reflect upon the danger I had been\nin. I would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my side of\nthe island; but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about. As\n",
        "403": "to the east side of the island, which I had gone round, I knew well\nenough there was no venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, and\nmy very blood run chill, but to think of it; and as to the other side\nof the island, I did not know how it might be there; but supposing the\ncurrent ran with the same force against the shore at the east as it\npassed by it on the other, I might run the same risk of being driven\ndown the stream, and carried by the island, as I had been before of\nbeing carried away from it: so with these thoughts, I contented myself\nto be without any boat, though it had been the product of so many\nmonths\u2019 labour to make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea.\nIn this government of my temper I remained near a year; and lived a\nvery sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose; and my thoughts\nbeing very much composed as to my condition, and fully comforted in\nresigning myself to the dispositions of Providence, I thought I lived\nreally very happily in all things except that of society.\nI improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises which my\nnecessities put me upon applying myself to; and I believe I should,\nupon occasion, have made a very good carpenter, especially considering\nhow few tools I had.\n",
        "404": "Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthenware,\nand contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, which I found\ninfinitely easier and better; because I made things round and shaped,\nwhich before were filthy things indeed to look on. But I think I was\nnever more vain of my own performance, or more joyful for anything I\nfound out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it\nwas a very ugly, clumsy thing when it was done, and only burned red,\nlike other earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the\nsmoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it, for I had been always used\nto smoke; and there were pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first,\nnot thinking there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards, when I\nsearched the ship again, I could not come at any pipes.\nIn my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made abundance of necessary\nbaskets, as well as my invention showed me; though not very handsome,\nyet they were such as were very handy and convenient for laying things\nup in, or fetching things home. For example, if I killed a goat abroad,\n",
        "405": "I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, dress it, and cut it in pieces,\nand bring it home in a basket; and the like by a turtle; I could cut it\nup, take out the eggs and a piece or two of the flesh, which was enough\nfor me, and bring them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me.\nAlso, large deep baskets were the receivers of my corn, which I always\nrubbed out as soon as it was dry and cured, and kept it in great\nbaskets.\nI began now to perceive my powder abated considerably; this was a want\nwhich it was impossible for me to supply, and I began seriously to\nconsider what I must do when I should have no more powder; that is to\nsay, how I should kill any goats. I had, as is observed in the third\n",
        "406": "year of my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame, and I\nwas in hopes of getting a he-goat; but I could not by any means bring\nit to pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and as I could never find in\nmy heart to kill her, she died at last of mere age.\nBut being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I have\nsaid, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap\nand snare the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them\nalive; and particularly I wanted a she-goat great with young. For this\npurpose I made snares to hamper them; and I do believe they were more\nthan once taken in them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire,\nand I always found them broken and my bait devoured. At length I\n",
        "407": "resolved to try a pitfall; so I dug several large pits in the earth, in\nplaces where I had observed the goats used to feed, and over those pits\nI placed hurdles of my own making too, with a great weight upon them;\nand several times I put ears of barley and dry rice without setting the\ntrap; and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten\nup the corn, for I could see the marks of their feet. At length I set\nthree traps in one night, and going the next morning I found them, all\nstanding, and yet the bait eaten and gone; this was very discouraging.\nHowever, I altered my traps; and not to trouble you with particulars,\ngoing one morning to see my traps, I found in one of them a large old\nhe-goat; and in one of the others three kids, a male and two females.\n",
        "408": "As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he was so fierce I\ndurst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to bring him away\nalive, which was what I wanted. I could have killed him, but that was\nnot my business, nor would it answer my end; so I even let him out, and\nhe ran away as if he had been frightened out of his wits. But I did not\nthen know what I afterwards learned, that hunger will tame a lion. If I\n",
        "409": "had let him stay three or four days without food, and then have carried\nhim some water to drink and then a little corn, he would have been as\ntame as one of the kids; for they are mighty sagacious, tractable\ncreatures, where they are well used.\nHowever, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time:\nthen I went to the three kids, and taking them one by one, I tied them\nwith strings together, and with some difficulty brought them all home.\nIt was a good while before they would feed; but throwing them some\nsweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be tame. And now I found\n",
        "410": "that if I expected to supply myself with goats\u2019 flesh, when I had no\npowder or shot left, breeding some up tame was my only way, when,\nperhaps, I might have them about my house like a flock of sheep. But\nthen it occurred to me that I must keep the tame from the wild, or else\nthey would always run wild when they grew up; and the only way for this\nwas to have some enclosed piece of ground, well fenced either with\nhedge or pale, to keep them in so effectually, that those within might\nnot break out, or those without break in.\nThis was a great undertaking for one pair of hands yet, as I saw there\nwas an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work was to find out a\nproper piece of ground, where there was likely to be herbage for them\nto eat, water for them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.\n",
        "411": "Those who understand such enclosures will think I had very little\ncontrivance when I pitched upon a place very proper for all these\n(being a plain, open piece of meadow land, or savannah, as our people\ncall it in the western colonies), which had two or three little drills\nof fresh water in it, and at one end was very woody\u2014I say, they will\nsmile at my forecast, when I shall tell them I began by enclosing this\npiece of ground in such a manner that, my hedge or pale must have been\nat least two miles about. Nor was the madness of it so great as to the\ncompass, for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough\nto do it in; but I did not consider that my goats would be as wild in\nso much compass as if they had had the whole island, and I should have\nso much room to chase them in that I should never catch them.\nMy hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards when\nthis thought occurred to me; so I presently stopped short, and, for the\nbeginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of about one hundred and fifty\nyards in length, and one hundred yards in breadth, which, as it would\nmaintain as many as I should have in any reasonable time, so, as my\nstock increased, I could add more ground to my enclosure.\n",
        "412": "This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with courage. I\nwas about three months hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done\nit, I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and used them to\nfeed as near me as possible, to make them familiar; and very often I\nwould go and carry them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and\nfeed them out of my hand; so that after my enclosure was finished and I\nlet them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating after me for\na handful of corn.\nThis answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had a flock of\nabout twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years more I had\nthree-and-forty, besides several that I took and killed for my food.\n",
        "413": "After that, I enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them in,\nwith little pens to drive them to take them as I wanted, and gates out\nof one piece of ground into another.\nBut this was not all; for now I not only had goat\u2019s flesh to feed on\nwhen I pleased, but milk too\u2014a thing which, indeed, in the beginning, I\ndid not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts,\nwas really an agreeable surprise, for now I set up my dairy, and had\nsometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives\nsupplies of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make\nuse of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen\nbutter or cheese made only when I was a boy, after a great many essays\nand miscarriages, made both butter and cheese at last, also salt\n(though I found it partly made to my hand by the heat of the sun upon\nsome of the rocks of the sea), and never wanted it afterwards.

        "414": "mercifully can our Creator treat His creatures, even in those\nconditions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction!

        "419": "I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat\u2019s skin, with a flap\nhanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the\nrain off from running into my neck, nothing being so hurtful in these\nclimates as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.\nI had a short jacket of goat\u2019s skin, the skirts coming down to about\nthe middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the\nsame; the breeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair\nhung down such a length on either side that, like pantaloons, it\nreached to the middle of my legs; stockings and shoes I had none, but\nhad made me a pair of somethings, I scarce knew what to call them, like\nbuskins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like\nspatterdashes, but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the\nrest of my clothes.\nI had on a broad belt of goat\u2019s skin dried, which I drew together with\ntwo thongs of the same instead of buckles, and in a kind of a frog on\neither side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw\nand a hatchet, one on one side and one on the other. I had another belt\n",
        "420": "not so broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung over my\nshoulder, and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches,\nboth made of goat\u2019s skin too, in one of which hung my powder, in the\nother my shot. At my back I carried my basket, and on my shoulder my\ngun, and over my head a great clumsy, ugly, goat\u2019s-skin umbrella, but\nwhich, after all, was the most necessary thing I had about me next to\nmy gun. As for my face, the colour of it was really not so mulatto-like\nas one might expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living\nwithin nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard I had once suffered\n",
        "421": "to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both\nscissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what\ngrew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large pair of\nMahometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks at Sallee,\nfor the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did; of these\nmoustachios, or whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to hang\nmy hat upon them, but they were of a length and shape monstrous enough,\nand such as in England would have passed for frightful.\nBut all this is by-the-bye; for as to my figure, I had so few to\nobserve me that it was of no manner of consequence, so I say no more of\nthat. In this kind of dress I went my new journey, and was out five or\nsix days. I travelled first along the sea-shore, directly to the place\n",
        "422": "where I first brought my boat to an anchor to get upon the rocks; and\nhaving no boat now to take care of, I went over the land a nearer way\nto the same height that I was upon before, when, looking forward to the\npoints of the rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to double\nwith my boat, as is said above, I was surprised to see the sea all\nsmooth and quiet\u2014no rippling, no motion, no current, any more there\nthan in other places. I was at a strange loss to understand this, and\nresolved to spend some time in the observing it, to see if nothing from\nthe sets of the tide had occasioned it; but I was presently convinced\nhow it was\u2014viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining\nwith the current of waters from some great river on the shore, must be\nthe occasion of this current, and that, according as the wind blew more\nforcibly from the west or from the north, this current came nearer or\nwent farther from the shore; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I\nwent up to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I\nplainly saw the current again as before, only that it ran farther off,\nbeing near half a league from the shore, whereas in my case it set\nclose upon the shore, and hurried me and my canoe along with it, which\nat another time it would not have done.\n",
        "423": "This observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to observe\nthe ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring\nmy boat about the island again; but when I began to think of putting it\nin practice, I had such terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of\nthe danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any\npatience, but, on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was\nmore safe, though more laborious\u2014and this was, that I would build, or\nrather make, me another periagua or canoe, and so have one for one side\nof the island, and one for the other.\nYou are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two plantations\nin the island\u2014one my little fortification or tent, with the wall about\nit, under the rock, with the cave behind me, which by this time I had\nenlarged into several apartments or caves, one within another. One of\nthese, which was the driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my\nwall or fortification\u2014that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to\nthe rock\u2014was all filled up with the large earthen pots of which I have\ngiven an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which\nwould hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my stores of\nprovisions, especially my corn, some in the ear, cut off short from the\nstraw, and the other rubbed out with my hand.\n",
        "424": "As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles, those piles\ngrew all like trees, and were by this time grown so big, and spread so\nvery much, that there was not the least appearance, to any one\u2019s view,\nof any habitation behind them.\nNear this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, and\nupon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land, which I kept duly\ncultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its\nseason; and whenever I had occasion for more corn, I had more land\nadjoining as fit as that.\nBesides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a tolerable\nplantation there also; for, first, I had my little bower, as I called\nit, which I kept in repair\u2014that is to say, I kept the hedge which\nencircled it in constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder\nstanding always in the inside. I kept the trees, which at first were no\n",
        "425": "more than stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall, always cut, so\nthat they might spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more\nagreeable shade, which they did effectually to my mind. In the middle\nof this I had my tent always standing, being a piece of a sail spread\nover poles, set up for that purpose, and which never wanted any repair\nor renewing; and under this I had made me a squab or couch with the\nskins of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft things, and a\nblanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had\nsaved; and a great watch-coat to cover me. And here, whenever I had\noccasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my country\nhabitation.\n",
        "426": "Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to say my\ngoats, and I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and\nenclose this ground. I was so anxious to see it kept entire, lest the\ngoats should break through, that I never left off till, with infinite\nlabour, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes,\nand so near to one another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and\nthere was scarce room to put a hand through between them; which\nafterwards, when those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy\nseason, made the enclosure strong like a wall, indeed stronger than any\nwall.\nThis will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no\npains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable\nsupport, for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus\nat my hand would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and\ncheese for me as long as I lived in the place, if it were to be forty\nyears; and that keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my\nperfecting my enclosures to such a degree that I might be sure of\nkeeping them together; which by this method, indeed, I so effectually\nsecured, that when these little stakes began to grow, I had planted\nthem so very thick that I was forced to pull some of them up again.\n",
        "427": "In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally\ndepended on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never failed to\npreserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my\nwhole diet; and indeed they were not only agreeable, but medicinal,\nwholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree.\nAs this was also about half-way between my other habitation and the\nplace where I had laid up my boat, I generally stayed and lay here in\nmy way thither, for I used frequently to visit my boat; and I kept all\nthings about or belonging to her in very good order. Sometimes I went\nout in her to divert myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go,\nscarcely ever above a stone\u2019s cast or two from the shore, I was so\napprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents\nor winds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new scene of my\n",
        "428": "life.\nIt happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I was\nexceedingly surprised with the print of a man\u2019s naked foot on the\nshore, which was very plain to be seen on the sand. I stood like one\nthunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I listened, I looked\n",
        "429": "round me, but I could hear nothing, nor see anything; I went up to a\nrising ground to look farther; I went up the shore and down the shore,\nbut it was all one; I could see no other impression but that one. I\nwent to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe if it\nmight not be my fancy; but there was no room for that, for there was\nexactly the print of a foot\u2014toes, heel, and every part of a foot. How\nit came thither I knew not, nor could I in the least imagine; but after\ninnumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused and out\nof myself, I came home to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the\nground I went on, but terrified to the last degree, looking behind me\nat every two or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and\nfancying every stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible to\n",
        "430": "describe how many various shapes my affrighted imagination represented\nthings to me in, how many wild ideas were found every moment in my\nfancy, and what strange, unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts\nby the way.\nWhen I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after this),\nI fled into it like one pursued. Whether I went over by the ladder, as\nfirst contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I had called\na door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next morning,\nfor never frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more\nterror of mind than I to this retreat.\n",
        "431": "I slept none that night; the farther I was from the occasion of my\nfright, the greater my apprehensions were, which is something contrary\nto the nature of such things, and especially to the usual practice of\nall creatures in fear; but I was so embarrassed with my own frightful\nideas of the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to\nmyself, even though I was now a great way off. Sometimes I fancied it\nmust be the devil, and reason joined in with me in this supposition,\nfor how should any other thing in human shape come into the place?\nWhere was the vessel that brought them? What marks were there of any\n",
        "432": "other footstep? And how was it possible a man should come there? But\nthen, to think that Satan should take human shape upon him in such a\nplace, where there could be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave\nthe print of his foot behind him, and that even for no purpose too, for\nhe could not be sure I should see it\u2014this was an amusement the other\nway. I considered that the devil might have found out abundance of\nother ways to have terrified me than this of the single print of a\nfoot; that as I lived quite on the other side of the island, he would\nnever have been so simple as to leave a mark in a place where it was\nten thousand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in the\nsand too, which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would\nhave defaced entirely. All this seemed inconsistent with the thing\n",
        "433": "itself and with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of\nthe devil.\nAbundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all\napprehensions of its being the devil; and I presently concluded then\nthat it must be some more dangerous creature\u2014viz. that it must be some\nof the savages of the mainland opposite who had wandered out to sea in\ntheir canoes, and either driven by the currents or by contrary winds,\nhad made the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away again to\nsea; being as loath, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate island as\nI would have been to have had them.\n",
        "434": "While these reflections were rolling in my mind, I was very thankful in\nmy thoughts that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time,\nor that they did not see my boat, by which they would have concluded\nthat some inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps have searched\nfarther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about\ntheir having found out my boat, and that there were people here; and\nthat, if so, I should certainly have them come again in greater numbers\nand devour me; that if it should happen that they should not find me,\nyet they would find my enclosure, destroy all my corn, and carry away\nall my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.\nThus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former confidence\nin God, which was founded upon such wonderful experience as I had had\nof His goodness; as if He that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not\npreserve, by His power, the provision which He had made for me by His\ngoodness. I reproached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any\n",
        "435": "more corn one year than would just serve me till the next season, as if\nno accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was\nupon the ground; and this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved\nfor the future to have two or three years\u2019 corn beforehand; so that,\nwhatever might come, I might not perish for want of bread.\nHow strange a chequer-work of Providence is the life of man! and by\nwhat secret different springs are the affections hurried about, as\ndifferent circumstances present! To-day we love what to-morrow we hate;\n",
        "436": "to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire what to-morrow\nwe fear, nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of. This was\nexemplified in me, at this time, in the most lively manner imaginable;\nfor I, whose only affliction was that I seemed banished from human\nsociety, that I was alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut\noff from mankind, and condemned to what I call silent life; that I was\nas one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the living,\nor to appear among the rest of His creatures; that to have seen one of\nmy own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life,\nand the greatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme\nblessing of salvation, could bestow; I say, that I should now tremble\nat the very apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into\nthe ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man having set\nhis foot in the island.\nSuch is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me a great many\ncurious speculations afterwards, when I had a little recovered my first\nsurprise.

        "437": "wise and good providence of God had determined for me; that as I could\nnot foresee what the ends of Divine wisdom might be in all this, so I\nwas not to dispute His sovereignty; who, as I was His creature, had an\nundoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as\nHe thought fit; and who, as I was a creature that had offended Him, had\nlikewise a judicial right to condemn me to what punishment He thought\nfit; and that it was my part to submit to bear His indignation, because\nI had sinned against Him. I then reflected, that as God, who was not\nonly righteous but omnipotent, had thought fit thus to punish and\nafflict me, so He was able to deliver me: that if He did not think fit\nto do so, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and\nentirely to His will; and, on the other hand, it was my duty also to\nhope in Him, pray to Him, and quietly to attend to the dictates and\ndirections of His daily providence.\nThese thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may say weeks and\nmonths: and one particular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I\ncannot omit.

In answer, I thankfully\n",
        "439": "laid down the book, and was no more sad, at least on that occasion.\nIn the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it\ncame into my thoughts one day that all this might be a mere chimera of\nmy own, and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I\ncame on shore from my boat: this cheered me up a little, too, and I\nbegan to persuade myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing\nelse but my own foot; and why might I not come that way from the boat,\nas well as I was going that way to the boat? Again, I considered also\nthat I could by no means tell for certain where I had trod, and where I\nhad not; and that if, at last, this was only the print of my own foot,\nI had played the part of those fools who try to make stories of\nspectres and apparitions, and then are frightened at them more than\nanybody.\n",
        "440": "Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had not\nstirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that I began to\nstarve for provisions; for I had little or nothing within doors but\nsome barley-cakes and water; then I knew that my goats wanted to be\nmilked too, which usually was my evening diversion: and the poor\ncreatures were in great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and,\nindeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk.\nEncouraging myself, therefore, with the belief that this was nothing\nbut the print of one of my own feet, and that I might be truly said to\nstart at my own shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my\ncountry house to milk my flock: but to see with what fear I went\nforward, how often I looked behind me, how I was ready every now and\nthen to lay down my basket and run for my life, it would have made any\none have thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had\nbeen lately most terribly frightened; and so, indeed, I had. However, I\nwent down thus two or three days, and having seen nothing, I began to\nbe a little bolder, and to think there was really nothing in it but my\nown imagination; but I could not persuade myself fully of this till I\nshould go down to the shore again, and see this print of a foot, and\nmeasure it by my own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness,\nthat I might be assured it was my own foot: but when I came to the\nplace, first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my boat\nI could not possibly be on shore anywhere thereabouts; secondly, when I\ncame to measure the mark with my own foot, I found my foot not so large\nby a great deal.

Thus, fear of\ndanger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself, when\napparent to the eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety greater, by\nmuch, than the evil which we are anxious about: and what was worse than\nall this, I had not that relief in this trouble that from the\nresignation I used to practise I hoped to have. I looked, I thought,\n",
        "443": "like Saul, who complained not only that the Philistines were upon him,\nbut that God had forsaken him; for I did not now take due ways to\ncompose my mind, by crying to God in my distress, and resting upon His\nprovidence, as I had done before, for my defence and deliverance;\nwhich, if I had done, I had at least been more cheerfully supported\nunder this new surprise, and perhaps carried through it with more\nresolution.\nThis confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but in the\nmorning I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of my mind, been as\nit were tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and\nwaked much better composed than I had ever been before. And now I began\nto think sedately; and, upon debate with myself, I concluded that this\nisland (which was so exceedingly pleasant, fruitful, and no farther\nfrom the mainland than as I had seen) was not so entirely abandoned as\nI might imagine; that although there were no stated inhabitants who\nlived on the spot, yet that there might sometimes come boats off from\nthe shore, who, either with design, or perhaps never but when they were\ndriven by cross winds, might come to this place; that I had lived there\nfifteen years now and had not met with the least shadow or figure of\nany people yet; and that, if at any time they should be driven here, it\nwas probable they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing\nthey had never thought fit to fix here upon any occasion; that the most\nI could suggest any danger from was from any casual accidental landing\nof straggling people from the main, who, as it was likely, if they were\ndriven hither, were here against their wills, so they made no stay\nhere, but went off again with all possible speed; seldom staying one\nnight on shore, lest they should not have the help of the tides and\ndaylight back again; and that, therefore, I had nothing to do but to\nconsider of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land\nupon the spot.\n",
        "444": "Now, I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as to\nbring a door through again, which door, as I said, came out beyond\nwhere my fortification joined to the rock: upon maturely considering\nthis, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the\nmanner of a semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had\nplanted a double row of trees about twelve years before, of which I\nmade mention: these trees having been planted so thick before, they\nwanted but few piles to be driven between them, that they might be\nthicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon finished. So that I had\nnow a double wall; and my outer wall was thickened with pieces of\ntimber, old cables, and everything I could think of, to make it strong;\nhaving in it seven little holes, about as big as I might put my arm out\nat. In the inside of this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick\nwith continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the\nfoot of the wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven holes I\ncontrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I had got\nseven on shore out of the ship; these I planted like my cannon, and\nfitted them into frames, that held them like a carriage, so that I\ncould fire all the seven guns in two minutes\u2019 time; this wall I was\nmany a weary month in finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till\nit was done.\n",
        "445": "When this was done I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a great\nlength every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood,\nwhich I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch that I\nbelieve I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty\nlarge space between them and my wall, that I might have room to see an\nenemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they\nattempted to approach my outer wall.\nThus in two years\u2019 time I had a thick grove; and in five or six years\u2019\ntime I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so monstrously thick and\nstrong that it was indeed perfectly impassable: and no men, of what\nkind soever, could ever imagine that there was anything beyond it, much\nless a habitation. As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in\nand out (for I left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to a\npart of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to\nplace another ladder upon that; so when the two ladders were taken down\nno man living could come down to me without doing himself mischief; and\nif they had come down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.\n",
        "446": "Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my own\npreservation; and it will be seen at length that they were not\naltogether without just reason; though I foresaw nothing at that time\nmore than my mere fear suggested to me.\nCHAPTER XII. A CAVE RETREAT\nWhile this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other\naffairs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats:\nthey were not only a ready supply to me on every occasion, and began to\nbe sufficient for me, without the expense of powder and shot, but also\nwithout the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones; and I was loath to\nlose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over\nagain.\n",
        "447": "For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two\nways to preserve them: one was, to find another convenient place to dig\na cave underground, and to drive them into it every night; and the\nother was to enclose two or three little bits of land, remote from one\nanother, and as much concealed as I could, where I might keep about\nhalf-a-dozen young goats in each place; so that if any disaster\nhappened to the flock in general, I might be able to raise them again\nwith little trouble and time: and this though it would require a good\ndeal of time and labour, I thought was the most rational design.\nAccordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of\nthe island; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed, as my\nheart could wish: it was a little damp piece of ground in the middle of\nthe hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself\nonce before, endeavouring to come back that way from the eastern part\nof the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so\nsurrounded with woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at\nleast, it did not want near so much labour to make it so as the other\npiece of ground I had worked so hard at.\n",

All this labour I was at\nthe expense of, purely from my apprehensions on account of the print of\na man\u2019s foot; for as yet I had never seen any human creature come near\nthe island; and I had now lived two years under this uneasiness, which,\nindeed, made my life much less comfortable than it was before, as may\nbe well imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant\nsnare of the fear of man. And this I must observe, with grief, too,\nthat the discomposure of my mind had great impression also upon the\nreligious part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into\nthe hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I\nseldom found myself in a due temper for application to my Maker; at\nleast, not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was\nwont to do: I rather prayed to God as under great affliction and\npressure of mind, surrounded with danger, and in expectation every\nnight of being murdered and devoured before morning; and I must\ntestify, from my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness,\nlove, and affection, is much the more proper frame for prayer than that\nof terror and discomposure: and that under the dread of mischief\nimpending, a man is no more fit for a comforting performance of the\nduty of praying to God than he is for a repentance on a sick-bed; for\nthese discomposures affect the mind, as the others do the body; and the\ndiscomposure of the mind must necessarily be as great a disability as\nthat of the body, and much greater; praying to God being properly an\nact of the mind, not of the body.\n",

        "459": "After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my imagination\nput it in practice, I continually made my tour every morning to the top\nof the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about three\nmiles or more, to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming\nnear the island, or standing over towards it; but I began to tire of\nthis hard duty, after I had for two or three months constantly kept my\nwatch, but came always back without any discovery; there having not, in\nall that time, been the least appearance, not only on or near the\nshore, but on the whole ocean, so far as my eye or glass could reach\nevery way.\nAs long as I kept my daily tour to the hill, to look out, so long also\nI kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits seemed to be all the\nwhile in a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution as the killing\ntwenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence which I had not at all\nentered into any discussion of in my thoughts, any farther than my\npassions were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural\ncustom of the people of that country, who, it seems, had been suffered\nby Providence, in His wise disposition of the world, to have no other\nguide than that of their own abominable and vitiated passions; and\nconsequently were left, and perhaps had been so for some ages, to act\nsuch horrid things, and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but\nnature, entirely abandoned by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish\ndegeneracy, could have run them into. But now, when, as I have said, I\nbegan to be weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made so long\nand so far every morning in vain, so my opinion of the action itself\nbegan to alter; and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to\nconsider what I was going to engage in; what authority or call I had to\npretend to be judge and executioner upon these men as criminals, whom\nHeaven had thought fit for so many ages to suffer unpunished to go on,\nand to be as it were the executioners of His judgments one upon\nanother; how far these people were offenders against me, and what right\nI had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed\npromiscuously upon one another.

In the next place, it occurred to me\nthat although the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and\ninhuman, yet it was really nothing to me: these people had done me no\ninjury: that if they attempted, or I saw it necessary, for my immediate\npreservation, to fall upon them, something might be said for it: but\nthat I was yet out of their power, and they really had no knowledge of\nme, and consequently no design upon me; and therefore it could not be\njust for me to fall upon them; that this would justify the conduct of\nthe Spaniards in all their barbarities practised in America, where they\ndestroyed millions of these people; who, however they were idolators\nand barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in their\ncustoms, such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as\nto the Spaniards, very innocent people; and that the rooting them out\nof the country is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation\nby even the Spaniards themselves at this time, and by all other\nChristian nations of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural\npiece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man; and for which the\nvery name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible, to\nall people of humanity or of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of\nSpain were particularly eminent for the produce of a race of men who\nwere without principles of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to\nthe miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of generous temper in the\nmind.\nThese considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of a full\nstop; and I began by little and little to be off my design, and to\nconclude I had taken wrong measures in my resolution to attack the\nsavages; and that it was not my business to meddle with them, unless\nthey first attacked me; and this it was my business, if possible, to\nprevent: but that, if I were discovered and attacked by them, I knew my\nduty.

Upon the whole, I concluded\nthat I ought, neither in principle nor in policy, one way or other, to\nconcern myself in this affair: that my business was, by all possible\nmeans to conceal myself from them, and not to leave the least sign for\nthem to guess by that there were any living creatures upon the island\u2014I\nmean of human shape.

But\nstill plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself\na little with considering that the power and presence of God was\neverywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped forward again, and by\nthe light of the firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw\nlying on the ground a monstrous, frightful old he-goat, just making his\nwill, as we say, and gasping for life, and, dying, indeed, of mere old\nage. I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he\n",

I observed also that there was a place at the farther side of\nit that went in further, but was so low that it required me to creep\nupon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not;\nso, having no candle, I gave it over for that time, but resolved to go\nagain the next day provided with candles and a tinder-box, which I had\nmade of the lock of one of the muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.\n",

When I had got through the strait, I found the roof rose higher up,\nI believe near twenty feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in\nthe island, I daresay, as it was to look round the sides and roof of\nthis vault or cave\u2014the wall reflected a hundred thousand lights to me\nfrom my two candles.

This was a very agreeable discovery to me at\nthat time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or\nthree pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of\nany kind; I also carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.\nI fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were said to\nlive in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them;\nfor I persuaded myself, while I was here, that if five hundred savages\nwere to hunt me, they could never find me out\u2014or if they did, they\nwould not venture to attack me here.

WRECK OF A SPANISH SHIP\nI was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this island, and\nwas so naturalised to the place and the manner of living, that, could I\nbut have enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place\nto disturb me, I could have been content to have capitulated for\nspending the rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had\nlaid me down and died, like the old goat in the cave.

My dog was\na pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years of\nmy time, and then died of mere old age. As for my cats, they\n",

I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose name I knew\nnot, that I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the little\nstakes which I had planted before my castle-wall being now grown up to\na good thick grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees, and\nbred there, which was very agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, I\nbegan to be very well contented with the life I led, if I could have\nbeen secured from the dread of the savages. But it was otherwise\n",
        "479": "directed; and it may not be amiss for all people who shall meet with my\nstory to make this just observation from it: How frequently, in the\ncourse of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and\nwhich, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is\noftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we\ncan be raised again from the affliction we are fallen into. I could\ngive many examples of this in the course of my unaccountable life; but\nin nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in the\ncircumstances of my last years of solitary residence in this island.\nIt was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenty-third\nyear; and this, being the southern solstice (for winter I cannot call\nit), was the particular time of my harvest, and required me to be\npretty much abroad in the fields, when, going out early in the morning,\neven before it was thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a\nlight of some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two\nmiles, toward that part of the island where I had observed some savages\nhad been, as before, and not on the other side; but, to my great\naffliction, it was on my side of the island.\n",
        "480": "I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within\nmy grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised; and yet I\nhad no more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these\nsavages, in rambling over the island, should find my corn standing or\ncut, or any of my works or improvements, they would immediately\nconclude that there were people in the place, and would then never rest\ntill they had found me out. In this extremity I went back directly to\nmy castle, pulled up the ladder after me, and made all things without\nlook as wild and natural as I could.\nThen I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defence.\n",
        "481": "I loaded all my cannon, as I called them\u2014that is to say, my muskets,\nwhich were mounted upon my new fortification\u2014and all my pistols, and\nresolved to defend myself to the last gasp\u2014not forgetting seriously to\ncommend myself to the Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God\nto deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. I continued in this\nposture about two hours, and began to be impatient for intelligence\nabroad, for I had no spies to send out. After sitting a while longer,\nand musing what I should do in this case, I was not able to bear\nsitting in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder to the side of the\nhill, where there was a flat place, as I observed before, and then\npulling the ladder after me, I set it up again and mounted the top of\nthe hill, and pulling out my perspective glass, which I had taken on\npurpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground, and began to\nlook for the place. I presently found there were no less than nine\n",

It is not easy to imagine what\nconfusion this sight put me into, especially seeing them come on my\nside of the island, and so near to me; but when I considered their\ncoming must be always with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards\nto be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad\nwith safety all the time of the flood of tide, if they were not on\nshore before; and having made this observation, I went abroad about my\nharvest work with the more composure.\n",
        "483": "As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to the\nwestward I saw them all take boat and row (or paddle as we call it)\naway. I should have observed, that for an hour or more before they went\noff they were dancing, and I could easily discern their postures and\ngestures by my glass. I could not perceive, by my nicest observation,\nbut that they were stark naked, and had not the least covering upon\nthem; but whether they were men or women I could not distinguish.\n",
        "484": "As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my\nshoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great sword by my side\nwithout a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make went away\nto the hill where I had discovered the first appearance of all; and as\nsoon as I got thither, which was not in less than two hours (for I\ncould not go quickly, being so loaded with arms as I was), I perceived\nthere had been three canoes more of the savages at that place; and\nlooking out farther, I saw they were all at sea together, making over\nfor the main. This was a dreadful sight to me, especially as, going\ndown to the shore, I could see the marks of horror which the dismal\nwork they had been about had left behind it\u2014viz. the blood, the bones,\nand part of the flesh of human bodies eaten and devoured by those\nwretches with merriment and sport. I was so filled with indignation at\n",
        "485": "the sight, that I now began to premeditate the destruction of the next\nthat I saw there, let them be whom or how many soever.

        "486": "During all this time I was in a murdering humour, and spent most of my\nhours, which should have been better employed, in contriving how to\ncircumvent and fall upon them the very next time I should see\nthem\u2014especially if they should be divided, as they were the last time,\ninto two parties; nor did I consider at all that if I killed one\nparty\u2014suppose ten or a dozen\u2014I was still the next day, or week, or\nmonth, to kill another, and so another, even _ad infinitum_, till I\nshould be, at length, no less a murderer than they were in being\nman-eaters\u2014and perhaps much more so. I spent my days now in great\nperplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day or\nother fall into the hands of these merciless creatures; and if I did at\nany time venture abroad, it was not without looking around me with the\ngreatest care and caution imaginable. And now I found, to my great\ncomfort, how happy it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd of\ngoats, for I durst not upon any account fire my gun, especially near\nthat side of the island where they usually came, lest I should alarm\nthe savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them\ncome again with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with them in a few\ndays, and then I knew what to expect. However, I wore out a year and\n",

I started up in the\ngreatest haste imaginable; and, in a trice, clapped my ladder to the\nmiddle place of the rock, and pulled it after me; and mounting it the\nsecond time, got to the top of the hill the very moment that a flash of\nfire bid me listen for a second gun, which, accordingly, in about half\na minute I heard; and by the sound, knew that it was from that part of\nthe sea where I was driven down the current in my boat.

The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and, though the wind blew\nvery hard, yet it burned fairly out; so that I was certain, if there\nwas any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it. And no doubt they\n",
        "491": "did; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, I heard another gun, and\nafter that several others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire\nall night long, till daybreak: and when it was broad day, and the air\ncleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full east of\nthe island, whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish\u2014no, not\nwith my glass: the distance was so great, and the weather still\nsomething hazy also; at least, it was so out at sea.\nI looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did\nnot move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and\nbeing eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my\nhand, and ran towards the south side of the island to the rocks where I\nhad formerly been carried away by the current; and getting up there,\nthe weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to\nmy great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the night upon those\nconcealed rocks which I found when I was out in my boat; and which\nrocks, as they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind of\ncounter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering from the\nmost desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in in all my\nlife.

First, I imagined\nthat upon seeing my light they might have put themselves into their\nboat, and endeavoured to make the shore: but that the sea running very\nhigh, they might have been cast away. Other times I imagined that they\n",
        "493": "might have lost their boat before, as might be the case many ways;\nparticularly by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many\ntimes obliged men to stave, or take in pieces, their boat, and\nsometimes to throw it overboard with their own hands. Other times I\nimagined they had some other ship or ships in company, who, upon the\nsignals of distress they made, had taken them up, and carried them off.\nOther times I fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and\nbeing hurried away by the current that I had been formerly in, were\ncarried out into the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery\nand perishing: and that, perhaps, they might by this time think of\nstarving, and of being in a condition to eat one another.\n",
        "494": "As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I was\nin, I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men,\nand pity them; which had still this good effect upon my side, that it\ngave me more and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily\nand comfortably provided for me in my desolate condition; and that of\ntwo ships\u2019 companies, who were now cast away upon this part of the\nworld, not one life should be spared but mine. I learned here again to\nobserve, that it is very rare that the providence of God casts us into\nany condition so low, or any misery so great, but we may see something\nor other to be thankful for, and may see others in worse circumstances\nthan our own. Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could\nnot so much as see room to suppose any were saved; nothing could make\nit rational so much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish\nthere, except the possibility only of their being taken up by another\nship in company; and this was but mere possibility indeed, for I saw\nnot the least sign or appearance of any such thing.

But it was not to be; either their fate or mine, or both,\nforbade it; for, till the last year of my being on this island, I never\nknew whether any were saved out of that ship or no; and had only the\naffliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on\nshore at the end of the island which was next the shipwreck.

This thought was no\nsooner in my head than I cast my eye upon a little hill which\nsufficiently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I had a\nclear view of the currents or sets of the tide, and which way I was to\nguide myself in my return.

        "505": "concluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it being\nin a storm, the sea broke so high and so continually over her, that the\nmen were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant\nrushing in of the water, as much as if they had been under water.\nBesides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that had life; nor\nany goods, that I could see, but what were spoiled by the water. There\nwere some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay\nlower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could see;\nbut they were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests, which I\n",
        "506": "believe belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of them into the\nboat, without examining what was in them. Had the stern of the ship\nbeen fixed, and the forepart broken off, I am persuaded I might have\nmade a good voyage; for by what I found in those two chests I had room\nto suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board; and, if I may\nguess from the course she steered, she must have been bound from Buenos\nAyres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the\nBrazils to the Havannah, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to\nSpain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use, at\nthat time, to anybody; and what became of the crew I then knew not.\n",
        "507": "I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of about\ntwenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty. There\nwere several muskets in the cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about\nfour pounds of powder in it; as for the muskets, I had no occasion for\nthem, so I left them, but took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel\nand tongs, which I wanted extremely, as also two little brass kettles,\na copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron; and with this cargo,\nand the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home again\u2014and the\nsame evening, about an hour within night, I reached the island again,\nweary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed that night in the boat\n",
        "508": "and in the morning I resolved to harbour what I had got in my new cave,\nand not carry it home to my castle. After refreshing myself, I got all\nmy cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars. The cask of\nliquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the\nBrazils; and, in a word, not at all good; but when I came to open the\nchests, I found several things of great use to me\u2014for example, I found\nin one a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled\nwith cordial waters, fine and very good; the bottles held about three\npints each, and were tipped with silver. I found two pots of very good\n",
        "509": "succades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top that the\nsalt-water had not hurt them; and two more of the same, which the water\nhad spoiled. I found some very good shirts, which were very welcome to\nme; and about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and\ncoloured neckcloths; the former were also very welcome, being\nexceedingly refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day. Besides this, when\nI came to the till in the chest, I found there three great bags of\npieces of eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all; and in\none of them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some\nsmall bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all weigh near a\npound. In the other chest were some clothes, but of little value; but,\n",
        "510": "by the circumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner\u2019s mate;\nthough there was no powder in it, except two pounds of fine glazed\npowder, in three flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their\nfowling-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I got very little by this\nvoyage that was of any use to me; for, as to the money, I had no manner\nof occasion for it; it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would\nhave given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and\nstockings, which were things I greatly wanted, but had had none on my\nfeet for many years. I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now, which I\ntook off the feet of two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck, and I\nfound two pair more in one of the chests, which were very welcome to\nme; but they were not like our English shoes, either for ease or\nservice, being rather what we call pumps than shoes. I found in this\n",
        "511": "seaman\u2019s chest about fifty pieces of eight, in rials, but no gold: I\nsupposed this belonged to a poorer man than the other, which seemed to\nbelong to some officer. Well, however, I lugged this money home to my\ncave, and laid it up, as I had done that before which I had brought\nfrom our own ship; but it was a great pity, as I said, that the other\npart of this ship had not come to my share: for I am satisfied I might\nhave loaded my canoe several times over with money; and, thought I, if\nI ever escape to England, it might lie here safe enough till I come\nagain and fetch it.\nCHAPTER XIV. A DREAM REALISED\n",
        "512": "Having now brought all my things on shore and secured them, I went back\nto my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old\nharbour, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old\nhabitation, where I found everything safe and quiet. I began now to\nrepose myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my family\naffairs; and for a while I lived easy enough, only that I was more\nvigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad\nso much; and if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was always\nto the east part of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the\nsavages never came, and where I could go without so many precautions,\nand such a load of arms and ammunition as I always carried with me if I\nwent the other way.\nI lived in this condition near two years more; but my unlucky head,\nthat was always to let me know it was born to make my body miserable,\nwas all these two years filled with projects and designs how, if it\nwere possible, I might get away from this island: for sometimes I was\nfor making another voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me that\nthere was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes\nfor a ramble one way, sometimes another\u2014and I believe verily, if I had\nhad the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea,\nbound anywhere, I knew not whither.\n",
        "513": "I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to those who are\ntouched with the general plague of mankind, whence, for aught I know,\none half of their miseries flow: I mean that of not being satisfied\nwith the station wherein God and Nature hath placed them\u2014for, not to\nlook back upon my primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my\nfather, the opposition to which was, as I may call it, my _original\nsin_, my subsequent mistakes of the same kind had been the means of my\ncoming into this miserable condition; for had that Providence which so\nhappily seated me at the Brazils as a planter blessed me with confined\ndesires, and I could have been contented to have gone on gradually, I\nmight have been by this time\u2014I mean in the time of my being in this\nisland\u2014one of the most considerable planters in the Brazils\u2014nay, I am\npersuaded, that by the improvements I had made in that little time I\nlived there, and the increase I should probably have made if I had\nremained, I might have been worth a hundred thousand moidores\u2014and what\nbusiness had I to leave a settled fortune, a well-stocked plantation,\nimproving and increasing, to turn supercargo to Guinea to fetch\nnegroes, when patience and time would have so increased our stock at\nhome, that we could have bought them at our own door from those whose\nbusiness it was to fetch them? and though it had cost us something\nmore, yet the difference of that price was by no means worth saving at\nso great a hazard.\nBut as this is usually the fate of young heads, so reflection upon the\nfolly of it is as commonly the exercise of more years, or of the\ndear-bought experience of time\u2014so it was with me now; and yet so deep\nhad the mistake taken root in my temper, that I could not satisfy\nmyself in my station, but was continually poring upon the means and\npossibility of my escape from this place; and that I may, with greater\npleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part of my story, it may\nnot be improper to give some account of my first conceptions on the\nsubject of this foolish scheme for my escape, and how, and upon what\nfoundation, I acted.\n",
        "514": "I am now to be supposed retired into my castle, after my late voyage to\nthe wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, as usual, and my\ncondition restored to what it was before: I had more wealth, indeed,\nthan I had before, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use\nfor it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there.\nIt was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the\nfour-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of\nsolitude, I was lying in my bed or hammock, awake, very well in health,\nhad no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, nor any uneasiness of\nmind more than ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes, that is,\nso as to sleep; no, not a wink all night long, otherwise than as\nfollows:\nIt is impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that\nwhirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in\nthis night\u2019s time. I ran over the whole history of my life in\nminiature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this\nisland, and also of that part of my life since I came to this island.\n",
        "515": "In my reflections upon the state of my case since I came on shore on\nthis island, I was comparing the happy posture of my affairs in the\nfirst years of my habitation here, with the life of anxiety, fear, and\ncare which I had lived in ever since I had seen the print of a foot in\nthe sand. Not that I did not believe the savages had frequented the\nisland even all the while, and might have been several hundreds of them\nat times on shore there; but I had never known it, and was incapable of\nany apprehensions about it; my satisfaction was perfect, though my\ndanger was the same, and I was as happy in not knowing my danger as if\nI had never really been exposed to it. This furnished my thoughts with\nmany very profitable reflections, and particularly this one: How\ninfinitely good that Providence is, which has provided, in its\ngovernment of mankind, such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of\nthings; and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand dangers,\nthe sight of which, if discovered to him, would distract his mind and\nsink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the events of\nthings hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers which\nsurround him.\n",
        "516": "After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to\nreflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many years\nin this very island, and how I had walked about in the greatest\nsecurity, and with all possible tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing\nbut the brow of a hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night,\nhad been between me and the worst kind of destruction\u2014viz. that of\nfalling into the hands of cannibals and savages, who would have seized\non me with the same view as I would on a goat or turtle; and have\nthought it no more crime to kill and devour me than I did of a pigeon\nor a curlew. I would unjustly slander myself if I should say I was not\nsincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular protection\nI acknowledged, with great humanity, all these unknown deliverances\nwere due, and without which I must inevitably have fallen into their\nmerciless hands.\n",
        "517": "When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken up in\nconsidering the nature of these wretched creatures, I mean the savages,\nand how it came to pass in the world that the wise Governor of all\nthings should give up any of His creatures to such inhumanity\u2014nay, to\nsomething so much below even brutality itself\u2014as to devour its own\nkind: but as this ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations,\nit occurred to me to inquire what part of the world these wretches\nlived in? how far off the coast was from whence they came? what they\nventured over so far from home for? what kind of boats they had? and\nwhy I might not order myself and my business so that I might be able to\ngo over thither, as they were to come to me?\n",
        "518": "I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do with\nmyself when I went thither; what would become of me if I fell into the\nhands of these savages; or how I should escape them if they attacked\nme; no, nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast,\nand not to be attacked by some or other of them, without any\npossibility of delivering myself; and if I should not fall into their\nhands, what I should do for provision, or whither I should bend my\ncourse; none of these thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way; but\nmy mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in my boat\nto the mainland. I looked upon my present condition as the most\nmiserable that could possibly be; that I was not able to throw myself\ninto anything but death, that could be called worse; and if I reached\nthe shore of the main I might perhaps meet with relief, or I might\ncoast along, as I did on the African shore, till I came to some\ninhabited country, and where I might find some relief; and after all,\nperhaps I might fall in with some Christian ship that might take me in:\nand if the worst came to the worst, I could but die, which would put an\nend to all these miseries at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of\na disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made desperate, as it were, by\nthe long continuance of my troubles, and the disappointments I had met\nin the wreck I had been on board of, and where I had been so near\nobtaining what I so earnestly longed for\u2014somebody to speak to, and to\nlearn some knowledge from them of the place where I was, and of the\nprobable means of my deliverance. I was agitated wholly by these\n",
        "519": "thoughts; all my calm of mind, in my resignation to Providence, and\nwaiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be\nsuspended; and I had as it were no power to turn my thoughts to\nanything but to the project of a voyage to the main, which came upon me\nwith such force, and such an impetuosity of desire, that it was not to\nbe resisted.\nWhen this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with such\nviolence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as\nif I had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervour of my\nmind about it, Nature\u2014as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the\nvery thoughts of it\u2014threw me into a sound sleep. One would have thought\nI should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything relating to\nit, but I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning as usual from\nmy castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages coming to\nland, and that they brought with them another savage whom they were\ngoing to kill in order to eat him; when, on a sudden, the savage that\nthey were going to kill jumped away, and ran for his life; and I\nthought in my sleep that he came running into my little thick grove\nbefore my fortification, to hide himself; and that I seeing him alone,\nand not perceiving that the others sought him that way, showed myself\nto him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he kneeled down to\nme, seeming to pray me to assist him; upon which I showed him my\nladder, made him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he became my\nservant; and that as soon as I had got this man, I said to myself, \u201cNow\nI may certainly venture to the mainland, for this fellow will serve me\nas a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for\nprovisions, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what\nplaces to venture into, and what to shun.\u201d I waked with this thought;\n",
        "520": "and was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of\nmy escape in my dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon\ncoming to myself, and finding that it was no more than a dream, were\nequally extravagant the other way, and threw me into a very great\ndejection of spirits.\nUpon this, however, I made this conclusion: that my only way to go\nabout to attempt an escape was, to endeavour to get a savage into my\npossession: and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners, whom\nthey had condemned to be eaten, and should bring hither to kill. But\nthese thoughts still were attended with this difficulty: that it was\nimpossible to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them,\nand killing them all; and this was not only a very desperate attempt,\nand might miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the\nlawfulness of it to myself; and my heart trembled at the thoughts of\nshedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance. I need not\n",
        "521": "repeat the arguments which occurred to me against this, they being the\nsame mentioned before; but though I had other reasons to offer now\u2014viz.\nthat those men were enemies to my life, and would devour me if they\ncould; that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver\nmyself from this death of a life, and was acting in my own defence as\nmuch as if they were actually assaulting me, and the like; I say though\nthese things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human blood\nfor my deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as I could by no\nmeans reconcile myself to for a great while. However, at last, after\nmany secret disputes with myself, and after great perplexities about it\n(for all these arguments, one way and another, struggled in my head a\nlong time), the eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length\nmastered all the rest; and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these\nsavages into my hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to\n",
        "522": "contrive how to do it, and this, indeed, was very difficult to resolve\non; but as I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved\nto put myself upon the watch, to see them when they came on shore, and\nleave the rest to the event; taking such measures as the opportunity\nshould present, let what would be.\nWith these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the scout as\noften as possible, and indeed so often that I was heartily tired of it;\nfor it was above a year and a half that I waited; and for great part of\nthat time went out to the west end, and to the south-west corner of the\nisland almost every day, to look for canoes, but none appeared. This\nwas very discouraging, and began to trouble me much, though I cannot\nsay that it did in this case (as it had done some time before) wear off\nthe edge of my desire to the thing; but the longer it seemed to be\ndelayed, the more eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first so\ncareful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by\nthem, as I was now eager to be upon them. Besides, I fancied myself\n",
        "523": "able to manage one, nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to\nmake them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them,\nand to prevent their being able at any time to do me any hurt. It was a\ngreat while that I pleased myself with this affair; but nothing still\npresented itself; all my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no\nsavages came near me for a great while.\nAbout a year and a half after I entertained these notions (and by long\nmusing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing, for want of an\noccasion to put them into execution), I was surprised one morning by\nseeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my side the\nisland, and the people who belonged to them all landed and out of my\nsight. The number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many,\n",
        "524": "and knowing that they always came four or six, or sometimes more in a\nboat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my measures\nto attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so lay still in my\ncastle, perplexed and discomforted. However, I put myself into the same\nposition for an attack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready\nfor action, if anything had presented. Having waited a good while,\nlistening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being very\nimpatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to\nthe top of the hill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so, however,\nthat my head did not appear above the hill, so that they could not\nperceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the help of my\n",

How they had\ncooked it I knew not, or what it was; but they were all dancing, in I\nknow not how many barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, round\nthe fire.\nWhile I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspective, two\nmiserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they were\nlaid by, and were now brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of\n",

I was dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge,\nwhen I perceived him run my way; and especially when, as I thought, I\nsaw him pursued by the whole body: and now I expected that part of my\ndream was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in\nmy grove; but I could not depend, by any means, upon my dream, that the\nother savages would not pursue him thither and find him there. However,\n",
        "527": "I kept my station, and my spirits began to recover when I found that\nthere was not above three men that followed him; and still more was I\nencouraged, when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly in\nrunning, and gained ground on them; so that, if he could but hold out\nfor half-an-hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from them all.\nThere was between them and my castle the creek, which I mentioned often\nin the first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes out of the\nship; and this I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor\nwretch would be taken there; but when the savage escaping came thither,\nhe made nothing of it, though the tide was then up; but plunging in,\nswam through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran\nwith exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three persons came to\nthe creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the third could\nnot, and that, standing on the other side, he looked at the others, but\nwent no farther, and soon after went softly back again; which, as it\nhappened, was very well for him in the end. I observed that the two who\n",

It came very warmly upon my thoughts,\nand indeed irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a servant,\nand, perhaps, a companion or assistant; and that I was plainly called\nby Providence to save this poor creature\u2019s life. I immediately ran down\nthe ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they\nwere both at the foot of the ladders, as I observed before, and getting\nup again with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards\nthe sea; and having a very short cut, and all down hill, placed myself\nin the way between the pursuers and the pursued, hallowing aloud to him\nthat fled, who, looking back, was at first perhaps as much frightened\nat me as at them; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come back; and,\nin the meantime, I slowly advanced towards the two that followed; then\nrushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of\nmy piece. I was loath to fire, because I would not have the rest hear;\n",

The poor savage who\nfled, but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen and\nkilled, as he thought, yet was so frightened with the fire and noise of\nmy piece that he stood stock still, and neither came forward nor went\nbackward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to come\non.

I smiled at him, and\nlooked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer; at length\nhe came close to me; and then he kneeled down again, kissed the ground,\nand laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my\nfoot upon his head; this, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my\nslave for ever. I took him up and made much of him, and encouraged him\n",

But there was\nno time for such reflections now; the savage who was knocked down\nrecovered himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, and I perceived\nthat my savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my\nother piece at the man, as if I would shoot him: upon this my savage,\nfor so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my sword, which\nhung naked in a belt by my side, which I did.

When he had done\nthis, he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and brought me the\nsword again, and with abundance of gestures which I did not understand,\nlaid it down, with the head of the savage that he had killed, just\nbefore me.

Then, calling\naway, I carried him, not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on\nthe farther part of the island: so I did not let my dream come to pass\nin that part, that he came into my grove for shelter. Here I gave him\nbread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of water, which I\nfound he was indeed in great distress for, from his running: and having\nrefreshed him, I made signs for him to go and lie down to sleep,\nshowing him a place where I had laid some rice-straw, and a blanket\nupon it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor\ncreature lay down, and went to sleep.\n",
        "535": "He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with straight,\nstrong limbs, not too large; tall, and well-shaped; and, as I reckon,\nabout twenty-six years of age. He had a very good countenance, not a\nfierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have something very manly in his\nface; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of a European in\nhis countenance, too, especially when he smiled. His hair was long and\nblack, not curled like wool; his forehead very high and large; and a\ngreat vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his\n",
        "536": "skin was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not an ugly, yellow,\nnauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virginians, and other natives of\nAmerica are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive-colour, that had in it\nsomething very agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His face\nwas round and plump; his nose small, not flat, like the negroes; a very\ngood mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well set, and as white as\nivory.\nAfter he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half-an-hour, he awoke\nagain, and came out of the cave to me, for I had been milking my goats\nwhich I had in the enclosure just by: when he espied me he came running\nto me, laying himself down again upon the ground, with all the possible\nsigns of an humble, thankful disposition, making a great many antic\ngestures to show it. At last he lays his head flat upon the ground,\n",
        "537": "close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as he had done\nbefore; and after this made all the signs to me of subjection,\nservitude, and submission imaginable, to let me know how he would serve\nme so long as he lived. I understood him in many things, and let him\nknow I was very well pleased with him. In a little time I began to\nspeak to him; and teach him to speak to me; and first, I let him know\nhis name should be Friday, which was the day I saved his life; I called\nhim so for the memory of the time. I likewise taught him to say Master;\n",
        "538": "and then let him know that was to be my name; I likewise taught him to\nsay Yes and No and to know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in\nan earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop my\nbread in it; and gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which he\nquickly complied with, and made signs that it was very good for him. I\nkept there with him all that night; but as soon as it was day I\nbeckoned to him to come with me, and let him know I would give him some\nclothes; at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark naked. As we\n",
        "539": "went by the place where he had buried the two men, he pointed exactly\nto the place, and showed me the marks that he had made to find them\nagain, making signs to me that we should dig them up again and eat\nthem. At this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it,\nmade as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my\nhand to him to come away, which he did immediately, with great\nsubmission. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if his\nenemies were gone; and pulling out my glass I looked, and saw plainly\nthe place where they had been, but no appearance of them or their\ncanoes; so that it was plain they were gone, and had left their two\ncomrades behind them, without any search after them.\n",
        "540": "But I was not content with this discovery; but having now more courage,\nand consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving\nhim the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I\nfound he could use very dexterously, making him carry one gun for me,\nand I two for myself; and away we marched to the place where these\ncreatures had been; for I had a mind now to get some further\nintelligence of them. When I came to the place my very blood ran chill\nin my veins, and my heart sunk within me, at the horror of the\nspectacle; indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me,\nthough Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered with human\nbones, the ground dyed with their blood, and great pieces of flesh left\nhere and there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short, all\nthe tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making there, after a\nvictory over their enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands, and the\n",
        "541": "bones of three or four legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of\nthe bodies; and Friday, by his signs, made me understand that they\nbrought over four prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were\neaten up, and that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth; that there\nhad been a great battle between them and their next king, of whose\nsubjects, it seems, he had been one, and that they had taken a great\nnumber of prisoners; all which were carried to several places by those\nwho had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon them, as was\ndone here by these wretches upon those they brought hither.\nI caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and whatever\nremained, and lay them together in a heap, and make a great fire upon\nit, and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a hankering\nstomach after some of the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his\nnature; but I showed so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and\nat the least appearance of it, that he durst not discover it: for I\nhad, by some means, let him know that I would kill him if he offered\nit.\n",
        "542": "When he had done this, we came back to our castle; and there I fell to\nwork for my man Friday; and first of all, I gave him a pair of linen\ndrawers, which I had out of the poor gunner\u2019s chest I mentioned, which\nI found in the wreck, and which, with a little alteration, fitted him\nvery well; and then I made him a jerkin of goat\u2019s skin, as well as my\nskill would allow (for I was now grown a tolerably good tailor); and I\ngave him a cap which I made of hare\u2019s skin, very convenient, and\nfashionable enough; and thus he was clothed, for the present, tolerably\nwell, and was mighty well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed\nas his master. It is true he went awkwardly in these clothes at first:\nwearing the drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the\nwaistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms; but a little\neasing them where he complained they hurt him, and using himself to\nthem, he took to them at length very well.\nThe next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I began to\nconsider where I should lodge him: and that I might do well for him and\nyet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the\nvacant place between my two fortifications, in the inside of the last,\nand in the outside of the first. As there was a door or entrance there\n",
        "543": "into my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to it, of\nboards, and set it up in the passage, a little within the entrance;\nand, causing the door to open in the inside, I barred it up in the\nnight, taking in my ladders, too; so that Friday could no way come at\nme in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so much noise in\ngetting over that it must needs awaken me; for my first wall had now a\ncomplete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning\nup to the side of the hill; which was again laid across with smaller\nsticks, instead of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with\nthe rice-straw, which was strong, like reeds; and at the hole or place\nwhich was left to go in or out by the ladder I had placed a kind of\ntrap-door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would not\nhave opened at all, but would have fallen down and made a great\nnoise\u2014as to weapons, I took them all into my side every night. But I\nneeded none of all this precaution; for never man had a more faithful,\nloving, sincere servant than Friday was to me: without passions,\nsullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged; his very\naffections were tied to me, like those of a child to a father; and I\ndaresay he would have sacrificed his life to save mine upon any\noccasion whatsoever\u2014the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out\nof doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions for\nmy safety on his account.\nThis frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, that\nhowever it had pleased God in His providence, and in the government of\nthe works of His hands, to take from so great a part of the world of\nHis creatures the best uses to which their faculties and the powers of\ntheir souls are adapted, yet that He has bestowed upon them the same\npowers, the same reason, the same affections, the same sentiments of\nkindness and obligation, the same passions and resentments of wrongs,\nthe same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the\ncapacities of doing good and receiving good that He has given to us;\nand that when He pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these,\nthey are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right uses for\nwhich they were bestowed than we are. This made me very melancholy\n",
        "544": "sometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions presented, how mean\na use we make of all these, even though we have these powers\nenlightened by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and by\nthe knowledge of His word added to our understanding; and why it has\npleased God to hide the like saving knowledge from so many millions of\nsouls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage, would make a much\nbetter use of it than we did. From hence I sometimes was led too far,\nto invade the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were, arraign the\njustice of so arbitrary a disposition of things, that should hide that\nsight from some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty\nfrom both; but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this\nconclusion: first, that we did not know by what light and law these\nshould be condemned; but that as God was necessarily, and by the nature\nof His being, infinitely holy and just, so it could not be, but if\nthese creatures were all sentenced to absence from Himself, it was on\naccount of sinning against that light which, as the Scripture says, was\na law to themselves, and by such rules as their consciences would\nacknowledge to be just, though the foundation was not discovered to us;\nand secondly, that still as we all are the clay in the hand of the\npotter, no vessel could say to him, \u201cWhy hast thou formed me thus?\u201d\nBut to return to my new companion. I was greatly delighted with him,\n",
        "545": "and made it my business to teach him everything that was proper to make\nhim useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make him speak, and\nunderstand me when I spoke; and he was the aptest scholar that ever\nwas; and particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so\npleased when he could but understand me, or make me understand him,\nthat it was very pleasant for me to talk to him. Now my life began to\nbe so easy that I began to say to myself that could I but have been\nsafe from more savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from the\nplace where I lived.\nCHAPTER XV. FRIDAY\u2019S EDUCATION\n",
        "546": "After I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I thought\nthat, in order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding, and\nfrom the relish of a cannibal\u2019s stomach, I ought to let him taste other\nflesh; so I took him out with me one morning to the woods. I went,\nindeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock; and bring it home\nand dress it; but as I was going I saw a she-goat lying down in the\nshade, and two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday.\n\u201cHold,\u201d said I, \u201cstand still;\u201d and made signs to him not to stir:\nimmediately I presented my piece, shot, and killed one of the kids. The\n",
        "547": "poor creature, who had at a distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage,\nhis enemy, but did not know, nor could imagine how it was done, was\nsensibly surprised, trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed that I\nthought he would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or\nperceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel whether\nhe was not wounded; and, as I found presently, thought I was resolved\nto kill him: for he came and kneeled down to me, and embracing my\nknees, said a great many things I did not understand; but I could\neasily see the meaning was to pray me not to kill him.\nI soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm; and\ntaking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid\nwhich I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did:\nand while he was wondering, and looking to see how the creature was\nkilled, I loaded my gun again. By-and-by I saw a great fowl, like a\n",
        "548": "hawk, sitting upon a tree within shot; so, to let Friday understand a\nlittle what I would do, I called him to me again, pointed at the fowl,\nwhich was indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I say,\npointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under the\nparrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made him understand that\nI would shoot and kill that bird; accordingly, I fired, and bade him\nlook, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one\nfrightened again, notwithstanding all I had said to him; and I found he\nwas the more amazed, because he did not see me put anything into the\ngun, but thought that there must be some wonderful fund of death and\ndestruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or anything\nnear or far off; and the astonishment this created in him was such as\ncould not wear off for a long time; and I believe, if I would have let\nhim, he would have worshipped me and my gun. As for the gun itself, he\nwould not so much as touch it for several days after; but he would\nspeak to it and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by\nhimself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to desire it not to\nkill him. Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I\n",
        "549": "pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but\nstayed some time; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered\naway a good distance from the place where she fell: however, he found\nher, took her up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceived his\nignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun\nagain, and not to let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any\nother mark that might present; but nothing more offered at that time:\nso I brought home the kid, and the same evening I took the skin off,\nand cut it out as well as I could; and having a pot fit for that\npurpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some very good\nbroth. After I had begun to eat some I gave some to my man, who seemed\nvery glad of it, and liked it very well; but that which was strangest\nto him was to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the\nsalt was not good to eat; and putting a little into his own mouth, he\nseemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his\nmouth with fresh water after it: on the other hand, I took some meat\ninto my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for\nwant of salt, as much as he had done at the salt; but it would not do;\nhe would never care for salt with meat or in his broth; at least, not\nfor a great while, and then but a very little.\n",
        "550": "Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved to feast\nhim the next day by roasting a piece of the kid: this I did by hanging\nit before the fire on a string, as I had seen many people do in\nEngland, setting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one\nacross the top, and tying the string to the cross stick, letting the\nmeat turn continually. This Friday admired very much; but when he came\nto taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked\nit, that I could not but understand him: and at last he told me, as\nwell as he could, he would never eat man\u2019s flesh any more, which I was\nvery glad to hear.\nThe next day I set him to work beating some corn out, and sifting it in\nthe manner I used to do, as I observed before; and he soon understood\nhow to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the\nmeaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of; for after that I\nlet him see me make my bread, and bake it too; and in a little time\nFriday was able to do all the work for me as well as I could do it\nmyself.\n",
        "551": "I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed instead of one,\nI must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity\nof corn than I used to do; so I marked out a larger piece of land, and\nbegan the fence in the same manner as before, in which Friday worked\nnot only very willingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully: and\nI told him what it was for; that it was for corn to make more bread,\nbecause he was now with me, and that I might have enough for him and\nmyself too. He appeared very sensible of that part, and let me know\nthat he thought I had much more labour upon me on his account than I\nhad for myself; and that he would work the harder for me if I would\ntell him what to do.\nThis was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place.\n",
        "552": "Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost\neverything I had occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send\nhim to, and talked a great deal to me; so that, in short, I began now\nto have some use for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little\noccasion for before. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a\nsingular satisfaction in the fellow himself: his simple, unfeigned\nhonesty appeared to me more and more every day, and I began really to\nlove the creature; and on his side I believe he loved me more than it\nwas possible for him ever to love anything before.\nI had a mind once to try if he had any inclination for his own country\nagain; and having taught him English so well that he could answer me\nalmost any question, I asked him whether the nation that he belonged to\nnever conquered in battle? At which he smiled, and said\u2014\u201cYes, yes, we\n",
        "553": "always fight the better;\u201d that is, he meant always get the better in\nfight; and so we began the following discourse:\u2014\n_Master_.\u2014You always fight the better; how came you to be taken\nprisoner, then, Friday?\n_Friday_.\u2014My nation beat much for all that.\n",
        "554": "_Master_.\u2014How beat? If your nation beat them, how came you to be taken?\n_Friday_.\u2014They more many than my nation, in the place where me was;\nthey take one, two, three, and me: my nation over-beat them in the\nyonder place, where me no was; there my nation take one, two, great\nthousand.\n",
        "555": "_Master_.\u2014But why did not your side recover you from the hands of your\nenemies, then?\n_Friday_.\u2014They run, one, two, three, and me, and make go in the canoe;\n",
        "556": "my nation have no canoe that time.\n_Master_.\u2014Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with the men they\ntake? Do they carry them away and eat them, as these did?\n",
        "557": "_Friday_.\u2014Yes, my nation eat mans too; eat all up.\n_Master_.\u2014Where do they carry them?\n_Friday_.\u2014Go to other place, where they think.\n",
        "558": "_Master_.\u2014Do they come hither?\n_Friday_.\u2014Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else place.\n_Master_.\u2014Have you been here with them?\n",
        "559": "_Friday_.\u2014Yes, I have been here (points to the NW. side of the island,\nwhich, it seems, was their side).\nBy this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been among the\nsavages who used to come on shore on the farther part of the island, on\nthe same man-eating occasions he was now brought for; and some time\nafter, when I took the courage to carry him to that side, being the\nsame I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told me he\nwas there once, when they ate up twenty men, two women, and one child;\nhe could not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them by laying so\nmany stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.\n",
        "560": "I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows: that\nafter this discourse I had with him, I asked him how far it was from\nour island to the shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost. He\ntold me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost: but that after a\nlittle way out to sea, there was a current and wind, always one way in\nthe morning, the other in the afternoon. This I understood to be no\nmore than the sets of the tide, as going out or coming in; but I\nafterwards understood it was occasioned by the great draft and reflux\nof the mighty river Orinoco, in the mouth or gulf of which river, as I\nfound afterwards, our island lay; and that this land, which I perceived\nto be W. and NW., was the great island Trinidad, on the north point of\n",
        "561": "the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thousand questions about the\ncountry, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were\nnear; he told me all he knew with the greatest openness imaginable. I\nasked him the names of the several nations of his sort of people, but\ncould get no other name than Caribs; from whence I easily understood\nthat these were the Caribbees, which our maps place on the part of\nAmerica which reaches from the mouth of the river Orinoco to Guiana,\nand onwards to St. Martha. He told me that up a great way beyond the\n",
        "562": "moon, that was beyond the setting of the moon, which must be west from\ntheir country, there dwelt white bearded men, like me, and pointed to\nmy great whiskers, which I mentioned before; and that they had killed\nmuch mans, that was his word: by all which I understood he meant the\nSpaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over the whole\ncountry, and were remembered by all the nations from father to son.\nI inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this island, and get\namong those white men. He told me, \u201cYes, yes, you may go in two canoe.\u201d\nI could not understand what he meant, or make him describe to me what\nhe meant by two canoe, till at last, with great difficulty, I found he\nmeant it must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes.

        "563": "Friday\u2019s discourse I began to relish very well; and from this time I\nentertained some hopes that, one time or other, I might find an\nopportunity to make my escape from this place, and that this poor\nsavage might be a means to help me.\nDuring the long time that Friday had now been with me, and that he\nbegan to speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to lay a\nfoundation of religious knowledge in his mind; particularly I asked him\none time, who made him. The creature did not understand me at all, but\nthought I had asked who was his father\u2014but I took it up by another\nhandle, and asked him who made the sea, the ground we walked on, and\nthe hills and woods. He told me, \u201cIt was one Benamuckee, that lived\n",

He looked very grave, and,\nwith a perfect look of innocence, said, \u201cAll things say O to him.\u201d I\n",
        "565": "asked him if the people who die in his country went away anywhere? He\nsaid, \u201cYes; they all went to Benamuckee.\u201d Then I asked him whether\nthose they eat up went thither too. He said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n",
        "566": "From these things, I began to instruct him in the knowledge of the true\nGod; I told him that the great Maker of all things lived up there,\npointing up towards heaven; that He governed the world by the same\npower and providence by which He made it; that He was omnipotent, and\ncould do everything for us, give everything to us, take everything from\nus; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with great\nattention, and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being\nsent to redeem us; and of the manner of making our prayers to God, and\nHis being able to hear us, even in heaven. He told me one day, that if\nour God could hear us, up beyond the sun, he must needs be a greater\nGod than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet\ncould not hear till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt\nto speak to them. I asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him.\n",

By this I observed, that there is priestcraft\neven among the most blinded, ignorant pagans in the world; and the\npolicy of making a secret of religion, in order to preserve the\nveneration of the people to the clergy, not only to be found in the\nRoman, but, perhaps, among all religions in the world, even among the\nmost brutish and barbarous savages.\nI endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday; and told him\nthat the pretence of their old men going up to the mountains to say O\nto their god Benamuckee was a cheat; and their bringing word from\nthence what he said was much more so; that if they met with any answer,\nor spake with any one there, it must be with an evil spirit; and then I\nentered into a long discourse with him about the devil, the origin of\nhim, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason of it,\nhis setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped\ninstead of God, and as God, and the many stratagems he made use of to\ndelude mankind to their ruin; how he had a secret access to our\npassions and to our affections, and to adapt his snares to our\ninclinations, so as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and run\nupon our destruction by our own choice.\n",
        "568": "I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind about\nthe devil as it was about the being of a God. Nature assisted all my\narguments to evidence to him even the necessity of a great First Cause,\nan overruling, governing Power, a secret directing Providence, and of\nthe equity and justice of paying homage to Him that made us, and the\nlike; but there appeared nothing of this kind in the notion of an evil\nspirit, of his origin, his being, his nature, and above all, of his\ninclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor\ncreature puzzled me once in such a manner, by a question merely natural\nand innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I had been talking\na great deal to him of the power of God, His omnipotence, His aversion\nto sin, His being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity; how, as\nHe had made us all, He could destroy us and all the world in a moment;\nand he listened with great seriousness to me all the while.

        "611": "O bad!\u201d\u2014\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Friday?\u201d says I. \u201cO yonder there,\u201d says he,\n\u201cone, two, three canoes; one, two, three!\u201d By this way of speaking I\nconcluded there were six; but on inquiry I found there were but three.\n",
        "612": "\u201cWell, Friday,\u201d says I, \u201cdo not be frightened.\u201d So I heartened him up\nas well as I could. However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly\nscared, for nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look for\nhim, and would cut him in pieces and eat him; and the poor fellow\ntrembled so that I scarcely knew what to do with him. I comforted him\n",
        "613": "as well as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he, and\nthat they would eat me as well as him. \u201cBut,\u201d says I, \u201cFriday, we must\nresolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday?\u201d \u201cMe shoot,\u201d says he,\n\u201cbut there come many great number.\u201d \u201cNo matter for that,\u201d said I again;\n",
        "614": "\u201cour guns will fright them that we do not kill.\u201d So I asked him\nwhether, if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by\nme, and do just as I bid him. He said, \u201cMe die when you bid die,\nmaster.\u201d So I went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him; for I\n",
        "615": "had been so good a husband of my rum that I had a great deal left. When\nwe had drunk it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces, which we\nalways carried, and loaded them with large swan-shot, as big as small\npistol-bullets. Then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two\nslugs and five small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a\nbrace of bullets each. I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my\n",

When I had thus prepared myself, I\ntook my perspective glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to see\nwhat I could discover; and I found quickly by my glass that there were\none-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes; and that\ntheir whole business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon these\nthree human bodies: a barbarous feast, indeed! but nothing more than,\nas I had observed, was usual with them. I observed also that they had\n",
        "617": "landed, not where they had done when Friday made his escape, but nearer\nto my creek, where the shore was low, and where a thick wood came\nalmost close down to the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman\nerrand these wretches came about, filled me with such indignation that\nI came down again to Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down to\nthem and kill them all; and asked him if he would stand by me. He had\nnow got over his fright, and his spirits being a little raised with the\ndram I had given him, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, he\nwould die when I bid die.\n",
        "618": "In this fit of fury I divided the arms which I had charged, as before,\nbetween us; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three\nguns upon his shoulder, and I took one pistol and the other three guns\nmyself; and in this posture we marched out. I took a small bottle of\nrum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and\nbullets; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and\nnot to stir, or shoot, or do anything till I bid him, and in the\nmeantime not to speak a word. In this posture I fetched a compass to my\nright hand of near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into\nthe wood, so that I could come within shot of them before I should be\ndiscovered, which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.\n",
        "619": "While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began to\nabate my resolution: I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their\nnumber, for as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was\nsuperior to them\u2014nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to my\nthoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity I was in\nto go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done\nor intended me any wrong? who, as to me, were innocent, and whose\nbarbarous customs were their own disaster, being in them a token,\nindeed, of God\u2019s having left them, with the other nations of that part\nof the world, to such stupidity, and to such inhuman courses, but did\nnot call me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less\nan executioner of His justice\u2014that whenever He thought fit He would\ntake the cause into His own hands, and by national vengeance punish\nthem as a people for national crimes, but that, in the meantime, it was\nnone of my business\u2014that it was true Friday might justify it, because\nhe was a declared enemy and in a state of war with those very\nparticular people, and it was lawful for him to attack them\u2014but I could\nnot say the same with regard to myself. These things were so warmly\n",
        "620": "pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I would\nonly go and place myself near them that I might observe their barbarous\nfeast, and that I would act then as God should direct; but that unless\nsomething offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I\nwould not meddle with them.\nWith this resolution I entered the wood, and, with all possible\nwariness and silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched\ntill I came to the skirts of the wood on the side which was next to\nthem, only that one corner of the wood lay between me and them. Here I\ncalled softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree which was just at\nthe corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me word if\nhe could see there plainly what they were doing. He did so, and came\n",
        "621": "immediately back to me, and told me they might be plainly viewed\nthere\u2014that they were all about their fire, eating the flesh of one of\ntheir prisoners, and that another lay bound upon the sand a little from\nthem, whom he said they would kill next; and this fired the very soul\nwithin me. He told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the\nbearded men he had told me of, that came to their country in the boat.\nI was filled with horror at the very naming of the white bearded man;\nand going to the tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white man, who lay\nupon the beach of the sea with his hands and his feet tied with flags,\nor things like rushes, and that he was an European, and had clothes on.\n",
        "622": "There was another tree and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty\nyards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by going a\nlittle way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then I\nshould be within half a shot of them; so I withheld my passion, though\nI was indeed enraged to the highest degree; and going back about twenty\npaces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till I came to\nthe other tree, and then came to a little rising ground, which gave me\na full view of them at the distance of about eighty yards.\nI had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful wretches\nsat upon the ground, all close huddled together, and had just sent the\nother two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him perhaps limb by\nlimb to their fire, and they were stooping down to untie the bands at\nhis feet. I turned to Friday. \u201cNow, Friday,\u201d said I, \u201cdo as I bid\nthee.\u201d Friday said he would. \u201cThen, Friday,\u201d says I, \u201cdo exactly as you\n",
        "623": "see me do; fail in nothing.\u201d So I set down one of the muskets and the\nfowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his, and with\nthe other musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him to do the\nlike; then asking him if he was ready, he said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThen fire at\nthem,\u201d said I; and at the same moment I fired also.\n",
        "624": "Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he\nshot he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on my side I\nkilled one, and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful\nconsternation: and all of them that were not hurt jumped upon their\nfeet, but did not immediately know which way to run, or which way to\nlook, for they knew not from whence their destruction came. Friday kept\nhis eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I\ndid; so, as soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the piece,\nand took up the fowling-piece, and Friday did the like; he saw me cock\nand present; he did the same again. \u201cAre you ready, Friday?\u201d said I.\n",
        "625": "\u201cYes,\u201d says he. \u201cLet fly, then,\u201d says I, \u201cin the name of God!\u201d and with\nthat I fired again among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as\nour pieces were now loaded with what I call swan-shot, or small\npistol-bullets, we found only two drop; but so many were wounded that\nthey ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody,\nand most of them miserably wounded; whereof three more fell quickly\nafter, though not quite dead.\n\u201cNow, Friday,\u201d says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and taking up\nthe musket which was yet loaded, \u201cfollow me,\u201d which he did with a great\ndeal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood and showed myself,\nand Friday close at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I\n",
        "626": "shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too, and running as\nfast as I could, which, by the way, was not very fast, being loaded\nwith arms as I was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who was,\nas I said, lying upon the beach or shore, between the place where they\nsat and the sea. The two butchers who were just going to work with him\nhad left him at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible\nfright to the seaside, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more of\nthe rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him step\nforwards and fire at them; he understood me immediately, and running\nabout forty yards, to be nearer them, he shot at them; and I thought he\nhad killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a heap into the boat,\nthough I saw two of them up again quickly; however, he killed two of\nthem, and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the\nboat as if he had been dead.\n",
        "627": "While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and cut the\nflags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his hands and feet, I\nlifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue what he was. He\nanswered in Latin, Christianus; but was so weak and faint that he could\nscarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket and gave it\nhim, making signs that he should drink, which he did; and I gave him a\npiece of bread, which he ate. Then I asked him what countryman he was:\n",
        "628": "and he said, Espagniole; and being a little recovered, let me know, by\nall the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my debt for\nhis deliverance. \u201cSeignior,\u201d said I, with as much Spanish as I could\nmake up, \u201cwe will talk afterwards, but we must fight now: if you have\nany strength left, take this pistol and sword, and lay about you.\u201d He\ntook them very thankfully; and no sooner had he the arms in his hands,\nbut, as if they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers\nlike a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for the\ntruth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures\nwere so much frightened with the noise of our pieces that they fell\ndown for mere amazement and fear, and had no more power to attempt\ntheir own escape than their flesh had to resist our shot; and that was\nthe case of those five that Friday shot at in the boat; for as three of\nthem fell with the hurt they received, so the other two fell with the\nfright.\n",
        "629": "I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing to keep\nmy charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword:\nso I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from whence we\nfirst fired, and fetch the arms which lay there that had been\ndischarged, which he did with great swiftness; and then giving him my\nmusket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade them\ncome to me when they wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there\nhappened a fierce engagement between the Spaniard and one of the\nsavages, who made at him with one of their great wooden swords, the\nweapon that was to have killed him before, if I had not prevented it.\nThe Spaniard, who was as bold and brave as could be imagined, though\nweak, had fought the Indian a good while, and had cut two great wounds\non his head; but the savage being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in\nwith him, had thrown him down, being faint, and was wringing my sword\nout of his hand; when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting\nthe sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through the\nbody, and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running to help\nhim, could come near him.\n",
        "630": "Friday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches,\nwith no weapon in his hand but his hatchet: and with that he despatched\nthose three who as I said before, were wounded at first, and fallen,\nand all the rest he could come up with: and the Spaniard coming to me\nfor a gun, I gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued\ntwo of the savages, and wounded them both; but as he was not able to\nrun, they both got from him into the wood, where Friday pursued them,\nand killed one of them, but the other was too nimble for him; and\nthough he was wounded, yet had plunged himself into the sea, and swam\nwith all his might off to those two who were left in the canoe; which\nthree in the canoe, with one wounded, that we knew not whether he died\nor no, were all that escaped our hands of one-and-twenty. The account\nof the whole is as follows: Three killed at our first shot from the\ntree; two killed at the next shot; two killed by Friday in the boat;\ntwo killed by Friday of those at first wounded; one killed by Friday in\nthe wood; three killed by the Spaniard; four killed, being found\ndropped here and there, of the wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase\nof them; four escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not\ndead\u2014twenty-one in all.\nThose that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-shot, and\nthough Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find that he\nhit any of them. Friday would fain have had me take one of their\n",
        "631": "canoes, and pursue them; and indeed I was very anxious about their\nescape, lest, carrying the news home to their people, they should come\nback perhaps with two or three hundred of the canoes and devour us by\nmere multitude; so I consented to pursue them by sea, and running to\none of their canoes, I jumped in and bade Friday follow me: but when I\nwas in the canoe I was surprised to find another poor creature lie\nthere, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and\nalmost dead with fear, not knowing what was the matter; for he had not\nbeen able to look up over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard\nneck and heels, and had been tied so long that he had really but little\nlife in him.\nI immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes which they had bound him\nwith, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand or speak,\nbut groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still, that he was\nonly unbound in order to be killed. When Friday came to him I bade him\nspeak to him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out my\nbottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram, which, with the news of\nhis being delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat. But when\n",
        "632": "Friday came to hear him speak, and look in his face, it would have\nmoved any one to tears to have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced\nhim, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sang;\nthen cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and head; and then\nsang and jumped about again like a distracted creature. It was a good\nwhile before I could make him speak to me or tell me what was the\nmatter; but when he came a little to himself he told me that it was his\nfather.\nIt is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy\nand filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight of his\nfather, and of his being delivered from death; nor indeed can I\ndescribe half the extravagances of his affection after this: for he\nwent into the boat and out of the boat a great many times: when he went\nin to him he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his\nfather\u2019s head close to his bosom for many minutes together, to nourish\nit; then he took his arms and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with\nthe binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I,\nperceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub\nthem with, which did them a great deal of good.\n",
        "633": "This affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other\nsavages, who were now almost out of sight; and it was happy for us that\nwe did not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and before they\ncould be got a quarter of their way, and continued blowing so hard all\nnight, and that from the north-west, which was against them, that I\ncould not suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached\ntheir own coast.\nBut to return to Friday; he was so busy about his father that I could\nnot find in my heart to take him off for some time; but after I thought\nhe could leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping\nand laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme: then I asked him if\nhe had given his father any bread. He shook his head, and said, \u201cNone;\nugly dog eat all up self.\u201d I then gave him a cake of bread out of a\n",
        "634": "little pouch I carried on purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself;\nbut he would not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my\npocket two or three bunches of raisins, so I gave him a handful of them\nfor his father. He had no sooner given his father these raisins but I\nsaw him come out of the boat, and run away as if he had been bewitched,\nfor he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw: I say, he\nran at such a rate that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant;\nand though I called, and hallooed out too after him, it was all\none\u2014away he went; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come back\nagain, though not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer I found his\npace slacker, because he had something in his hand. When he came up to\n",
        "635": "me I found he had been quite home for an earthen jug or pot, to bring\nhis father some fresh water, and that he had got two more cakes or\nloaves of bread: the bread he gave me, but the water he carried to his\nfather; however, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little of it. The\nwater revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I had given\nhim, for he was fainting with thirst.\nWhen his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there was any\nwater left. He said, \u201cYes\u201d; and I bade him give it to the poor\n",
        "636": "Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his father; and I sent one\nof the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard too, who was indeed\nvery weak, and was reposing himself upon a green place under the shade\nof a tree; and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled\nwith the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw that upon\nFriday\u2019s coming to him with the water he sat up and drank, and took the\nbread and began to eat, I went to him and gave him a handful of\nraisins. He looked up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude and\nthankfulness that could appear in any countenance; but was so weak,\nnotwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could\nnot stand up upon his feet\u2014he tried to do it two or three times, but\nwas really not able, his ankles were so swelled and so painful to him;\nso I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe\nthem with rum, as he had done his father\u2019s.\n",
        "637": "I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or\nperhaps less, all the while he was here, turn his head about to see if\nhis father was in the same place and posture as he left him sitting;\nand at last he found he was not to be seen; at which he started up,\nand, without speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him that one\ncould scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went; but when\nhe came, he only found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs, so\nFriday came back to me presently; and then I spoke to the Spaniard to\nlet Friday help him up if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then\nhe should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take care of him.\nBut Friday, a lusty, strong fellow, took the Spaniard upon his back,\nand carried him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the side\nor gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it; and then\nlifting him quite in, he set him close to his father; and presently\nstepping out again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the\nshore faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too;\nso he brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving them in the\nboat, ran away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed me I spoke to\nhim, and asked him whither he went. He told me, \u201cGo fetch more boat;\u201d\n",
        "638": "so away he went like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like\nhim; and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to\nit by land; so he wafted me over, and then went to help our new guests\nout of the boat, which he did; but they were neither of them able to\nwalk; so that poor Friday knew not what to do.\nTo remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to Friday to\nbid them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind\nof hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them both up\ntogether upon it between us.\nBut when we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification, we\nwere at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them\nover, and I was resolved not to break it down; so I set to work again,\nand Friday and I, in about two hours\u2019 time, made a very handsome tent,\ncovered with old sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in\nthe space without our outward fence and between that and the grove of\nyoung wood which I had planted; and here we made them two beds of such\nthings as I had\u2014viz. of good rice-straw, with blankets laid upon it to\n",

It was remarkable, too, I had but three\nsubjects, and they were of three different religions\u2014my man Friday was\na Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard\nwas a Papist. However, I allowed liberty of conscience throughout my\ndominions. But this is by the way.\n",
        "641": "As soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued prisoners, and given them\nshelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of making some\nprovision for them; and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take\na yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock,\nto be killed; when I cut off the hinder-quarter, and chopping it into\nsmall pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, and made\nthem a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth; and as I\ncooked it without doors, for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I\ncarried it all into the new tent, and having set a table there for\nthem, I sat down, and ate my own dinner also with them, and, as well as\nI could, cheered them and encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter,\nespecially to his father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the\nSpaniard spoke the language of the savages pretty well.\nAfter we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one of\nthe canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other firearms, which, for\nwant of time, we had left upon the place of battle; and the next day I\nordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay\nopen to the sun, and would presently be offensive. I also ordered him\n",
        "642": "to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I could not\nthink of doing myself; nay, I could not bear to see them if I went that\nway; all which he punctually performed, and effaced the very appearance\nof the savages being there; so that when I went again, I could scarce\nknow where it was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to\nthe place.\nI then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new\nsubjects; and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he\nthought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we\nmight expect a return of them, with a power too great for us to resist.\nHis first opinion was, that the savages in the boat never could live\nout the storm which blew that night they went off, but must of\nnecessity be drowned, or driven south to those other shores, where they\nwere as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were\ncast away; but, as to what they would do if they came safe on shore, he\nsaid he knew not; but it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully\nfrightened with the manner of their being attacked, the noise, and the\nfire, that he believed they would tell the people they were all killed\nby thunder and lightning, not by the hand of man; and that the two\nwhich appeared\u2014viz.

This, however, I knew not; and\ntherefore was under continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept\nalways upon my guard, with all my army: for, as there were now four of\nus, I would have ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open\nfield, at any time.\n",

But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a\nserious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there\nwere sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who having been\ncast away and made their escape to that side, lived there at peace,\nindeed, with the savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries,\nand, indeed, for life. I asked him all the particulars of their voyage,\n",

I told him with freedom, I\nfeared mostly their treachery and ill-usage of me, if I put my life in\ntheir hands; for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of\nman, nor did men always square their dealings by the obligations they\nhad received so much as they did by the advantages they expected.

I added that, otherwise, I was persuaded,\nif they were all here, we might, with so many hands, build a barque\nlarge enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils southward, or\nto the islands or Spanish coast northward; but that if, in requital,\nthey should, when I had put weapons into their hands, carry me by force\namong their own people, I might be ill-used for my kindness to them,\nand make my case worse than it was before.\nHe answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuousness, that their\ncondition was so miserable, and that they were so sensible of it, that\nhe believed they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that\nshould contribute to their deliverance; and that, if I pleased, he\nwould go to them with the old man, and discourse with them about it,\nand return again and bring me their answer; that he would make\nconditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they should be\nabsolutely under my direction as their commander and captain; and they\nshould swear upon the holy sacraments and gospel to be true to me, and\ngo to such Christian country as I should agree to, and no other; and to\nbe directed wholly and absolutely by my orders till they were landed\nsafely in such country as I intended, and that he would bring a\ncontract from them, under their hands, for that purpose.

The case was thus: he had\nbeen with us now about a month, during which time I had let him see in\nwhat manner I had provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my\nsupport; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had laid\nup; which, though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was\nnot sufficient, without good husbandry, for my family, now it was\nincreased to four; but much less would it be sufficient if his\ncountrymen, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should come\nover; and least of all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if\nwe should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of\nAmerica; so he told me he thought it would be more advisable to let him\nand the other two dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I could\nspare seed to sow, and that we should wait another harvest, that we\nmight have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should come;\nfor want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think\nthemselves delivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into\nanother. \u201cYou know,\u201d says he, \u201cthe children of Israel, though they\nrejoiced at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled\neven against God Himself, that delivered them, when they came to want\nbread in the wilderness.\u201d\n",
        "650": "His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I could not\nbut be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied\nwith his fidelity; so we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as\nthe wooden tools we were furnished with permitted; and in about a\nmonth\u2019s time, by the end of which it was seed-time, we had got as much\nland cured and trimmed up as we sowed two-and-twenty bushels of barley\non, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had\nto spare: indeed, we left ourselves barely sufficient, for our own food\nfor the six months that we had to expect our crop; that is to say\nreckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; for it is not\nto be supposed it is six months in the ground in that country.\nHaving now society enough, and our numbers being sufficient to put us\nout of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their number had\nbeen very great, we went freely all over the island, whenever we found\noccasion; and as we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it\nwas impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine.\nFor this purpose I marked out several trees, which I thought fit for\nour work, and I set Friday and his father to cut them down; and then I\ncaused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to\noversee and direct their work.

But above all, the season for curing the\ngrapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in\nthe sun, that, I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of\nthe sun are cured, we could have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and\nthese, with our bread, formed a great part of our food\u2014very good living\ntoo, I assure you, for they are exceedingly nourishing.\n",

When we had thus housed\nand secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more\nwicker-ware, viz. great baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard\nwas very handy and dexterous at this part, and often blamed me that I\ndid not make some things for defence of this kind of work; but I saw no\nneed of it.\n",

How they were to\nhave done this, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a\nquestion which we never asked. Under these instructions, the Spaniard\n",

I gave\neach of them a musket, with a firelock on it, and about eight charges\nof powder and ball, charging them to be very good husbands of both, and\nnot to use either of them but upon urgent occasions.\nThis was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me in view\nof my deliverance for now twenty-seven years and some days.

They went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon was at\nfull, by my account in the month of October; but as for an exact\nreckoning of days, after I had once lost it I could never recover it\nagain; nor had I kept even the number of years so punctually as to be\nsure I was right; though, as it proved when I afterwards examined my\naccount, I found I had kept a true reckoning of years.\nIt was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a strange\nand unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has not, perhaps,\nbeen heard of in history.

They had so well aimed their\nshot at the men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and\nthe other very much wounded; but not being dead, he started up on his\nfeet, and called eagerly for help to the other; but the captain\nstepping to him, told him it was too late to cry for help, he should\ncall upon God to forgive his villainy, and with that word knocked him\ndown with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more; there\nwere three more in the company, and one of them was slightly wounded.\nBy this time I was come; and when they saw their danger, and that it\nwas in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told them he\n",
        "682": "would spare their lives if they would give him an assurance of their\nabhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear to\nbe faithful to him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying\nher back to Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave him all the\nprotestations of their sincerity that could be desired; and he was\nwilling to believe them, and spare their lives, which I was not\nagainst, only that I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while\nthey were on the island.\nWhile this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain\u2019s mate to the boat\nwith orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sails, which\nthey did; and by-and-by three straggling men, that were (happily for\nthem) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired; and\nseeing the captain, who was before their prisoner, now their conqueror,\nthey submitted to be bound also; and so our victory was complete.\n",
        "683": "It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one\nanother\u2019s circumstances. I began first, and told him my whole history,\nwhich he heard with an attention even to amazement\u2014and particularly at\nthe wonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions and\nammunition; and, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders,\nit affected him deeply. But when he reflected from thence upon himself,\nand how I seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his\nlife, the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word more.\n",
        "684": "After this communication was at an end, I carried him and his two men\ninto my apartment, leading them in just where I came out, viz. at the\ntop of the house, where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had,\nand showed them all the contrivances I had made during my long, long\ninhabiting that place.\nAll I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but above\nall, the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I had\nconcealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which having been now\nplanted nearly twenty years, and the trees growing much faster than in\nEngland, was become a little wood, so thick that it was impassable in\nany part of it but at that one side where I had reserved my little\nwinding passage into it. I told him this was my castle and my\n",
        "685": "residence, but that I had a seat in the country, as most princes have,\nwhither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him that too\nanother time; but at present our business was to consider how to\nrecover the ship. He agreed with me as to that, but told me he was\nperfectly at a loss what measures to take, for that there were still\nsix-and-twenty hands on board, who, having entered into a cursed\nconspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law,\nwould be hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it on,\nknowing that if they were subdued they would be brought to the gallows\nas soon as they came to England, or to any of the English colonies, and\nthat, therefore, there would be no attacking them with so small a\nnumber as we were.\nI mused for some time on what he had said, and found it was a very\nrational conclusion, and that therefore something was to be resolved on\nspeedily, as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their\nsurprise as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon\n",
        "686": "this, it presently occurred to me that in a little while the ship\u2019s\ncrew, wondering what was become of their comrades and of the boat,\nwould certainly come on shore in their other boat to look for them, and\nthat then, perhaps, they might come armed, and be too strong for us:\nthis he allowed to be rational. Upon this, I told him the first thing\nwe had to do was to stave the boat which lay upon the beach, so that\nthey might not carry her off, and taking everything out of her, leave\nher so far useless as not to be fit to swim. Accordingly, we went on\nboard, took the arms which were left on board out of her, and whatever\nelse we found there\u2014which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a\nfew biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a\npiece of canvas (the sugar was five or six pounds): all which was very\nwelcome to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had had none\nleft for many years.\n",
        "687": "When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, sail,\nand rudder of the boat were carried away before), we knocked a great\nhole in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master us,\nyet they could not carry off the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my\nthoughts that we could be able to recover the ship; but my view was,\nthat if they went away without the boat, I did not much question to\nmake her again fit to carry as to the Leeward Islands, and call upon\nour friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still in my\nthoughts.\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE SHIP RECOVERED\n",
        "688": "While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main\nstrength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so high that the tide would\nnot float her off at high-water mark, and besides, had broke a hole in\nher bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were set down musing what\nwe should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and make a waft with her\nensign as a signal for the boat to come on board\u2014but no boat stirred;\nand they fired several times, making other signals for the boat. At\nlast, when all their signals and firing proved fruitless, and they\nfound the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help of my glasses,\nhoist another boat out and row towards the shore; and we found, as they\napproached, that there were no less than ten men in her, and that they\nhad firearms with them.\nAs the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full view\nof them as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces; because\nthe tide having set them a little to the east of the other boat, they\nrowed up under shore, to come to the same place where the other had\nlanded, and where the boat lay; by this means, I say, we had a full\nview of them, and the captain knew the persons and characters of all\nthe men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were three very honest\nfellows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest,\nbeing over-powered and frightened; but that as for the boatswain, who\nit seems was the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they were\nas outrageous as any of the ship\u2019s crew, and were no doubt made\ndesperate in their new enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was\nthat they would be too powerful for us. I smiled at him, and told him\n",
        "689": "that men in our circumstances were past the operation of fear; that\nseeing almost every condition that could be was better than that which\nwe were supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the consequence,\nwhether death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I asked him\nwhat he thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether a\ndeliverance were not worth venturing for? \u201cAnd where, sir,\u201d said I, \u201cis\nyour belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life,\nwhich elevated you a little while ago? For my part,\u201d said I, \u201cthere\n",
        "690": "seems to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it.\u201d \u201cWhat is\nthat?\u201d say he. \u201cWhy,\u201d said I, \u201cit is, that as you say there are three\nor four honest fellows among them which should be spared, had they been\nall of the wicked part of the crew I should have thought God\u2019s\nprovidence had singled them out to deliver them into your hands; for\ndepend upon it, every man that comes ashore is our own, and shall die\nor live as they behave to us.\u201d As I spoke this with a raised voice and\n",
        "691": "cheerful countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set\nvigorously to our business.\nWe had, upon the first appearance of the boat\u2019s coming from the ship,\nconsidered of separating our prisoners; and we had, indeed, secured\nthem effectually. Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured\nthan ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three delivered men,\nto my cave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger of being\nheard or discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods if they\ncould have delivered themselves. Here they left them bound, but gave\n",
        "692": "them provisions; and promised them, if they continued there quietly, to\ngive them their liberty in a day or two; but that if they attempted\ntheir escape they should be put to death without mercy. They promised\nfaithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and were very\nthankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions and light\nleft them; for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for\ntheir comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel over\nthem at the entrance.\nThe other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept pinioned,\nindeed, because the captain was not able to trust them; but the other\ntwo were taken into my service, upon the captain\u2019s recommendation, and\nupon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them and\nthe three honest men we were seven men, well armed; and I made no doubt\nwe should be able to deal well enough with the ten that were coming,\nconsidering that the captain had said there were three or four honest\nmen among them also. As soon as they got to the place where their other\n",
        "693": "boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore,\nhauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to see, for I was\nafraid they would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance\nfrom the shore, with some hands in her to guard her, and so we should\nnot be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they\ndid, they ran all to their other boat; and it was easy to see they were\nunder a great surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was\nin her, and a great hole in her bottom. After they had mused a while\nupon this, they set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all\ntheir might, to try if they could make their companions hear; but all\nwas to no purpose. Then they came all close in a ring, and fired a\n",
        "694": "volley of their small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes made\nthe woods ring. But it was all one; those in the cave, we were sure,\ncould not hear; and those in our keeping, though they heard it well\nenough, yet durst give no answer to them. They were so astonished at\nthe surprise of this, that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved\nto go all on board again to their ship, and let them know that the men\nwere all murdered, and the long-boat staved; accordingly, they\nimmediately launched their boat again, and got all of them on board.\n",
        "695": "The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this,\nbelieving they would go on board the ship again and set sail, giving\ntheir comrades over for lost, and so he should still lose the ship,\nwhich he was in hopes we should have recovered; but he was quickly as\nmuch frightened the other way.\nThey had not been long put off with the boat, when we perceived them\nall coming on shore again; but with this new measure in their conduct,\nwhich it seems they consulted together upon, viz. to leave three men in\nthe boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to\nlook for their fellows. This was a great disappointment to us, for now\n",
        "696": "we were at a loss what to do, as our seizing those seven men on shore\nwould be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape; because they\nwould row away to the ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to\nweigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would be lost.\nHowever we had no remedy but to wait and see what the issue of things\nmight present. The seven men came on shore, and the three who remained\nin the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, and came to\nan anchor to wait for them; so that it was impossible for us to come at\nthem in the boat. Those that came on shore kept close together,\n",
        "697": "marching towards the top of the little hill under which my habitation\nlay; and we could see them plainly, though they could not perceive us.\nWe should have been very glad if they would have come nearer us, so\nthat we might have fired at them, or that they would have gone farther\noff, that we might come abroad. But when they were come to the brow of\nthe hill where they could see a great way into the valleys and woods,\nwhich lay towards the north-east part, and where the island lay lowest,\nthey shouted and hallooed till they were weary; and not caring, it\nseems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they\nsat down together under a tree to consider it. Had they thought fit to\n",
        "698": "have gone to sleep there, as the other part of them had done, they had\ndone the job for us; but they were too full of apprehensions of danger\nto venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell what the danger\nwas they had to fear.\nThe captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation of\ntheirs, viz. that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to\nendeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon\nthem just at the juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and\nthey would certainly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed.\n",
        "699": "I liked this proposal, provided it was done while we were near enough\nto come up to them before they could load their pieces again. But this\nevent did not happen; and we lay still a long time, very irresolute\nwhat course to take. At length I told them there would be nothing done,\nin my opinion, till night; and then, if they did not return to the\nboat, perhaps we might find a way to get between them and the shore,\nand so might use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on\nshore. We waited a great while, though very impatient for their\n",
        "700": "removing; and were very uneasy when, after long consultation, we saw\nthem all start up and march down towards the sea; it seems they had\nsuch dreadful apprehensions of the danger of the place that they\nresolved to go on board the ship again, give their companions over for\nlost, and so go on with their intended voyage with the ship.\nAs soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined it to be\nas it really was that they had given over their search, and were going\nback again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was\nready to sink at the apprehensions of it; but I presently thought of a\nstratagem to fetch them back again, and which answered my end to a\ntittle. I ordered Friday and the captain\u2019s mate to go over the little\ncreek westward, towards the place where the savages came on shore, when\nFriday was rescued, and so soon as they came to a little rising round,\nat about half a mile distant, I bid them halloo out, as loud as they\ncould, and wait till they found the seamen heard them; that as soon as\never they heard the seamen answer them, they should return it again;\nand then, keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when the\nothers hallooed, to draw them as far into the island and among the\nwoods as possible, and then wheel about again to me by such ways as I\ndirected them.\n",
        "701": "They were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hallooed;\nand they presently heard them, and answering, ran along the shore\nwestward, towards the voice they heard, when they were stopped by the\ncreek, where the water being up, they could not get over, and called\nfor the boat to come up and set them over; as, indeed, I expected. When\nthey had set themselves over, I observed that the boat being gone a\ngood way into the creek, and, as it were, in a harbour within the land,\nthey took one of the three men out of her, to go along with them, and\nleft only two in the boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little\ntree on the shore. This was what I wished for; and immediately leaving\nFriday and the captain\u2019s mate to their business, I took the rest with\nme; and, crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two\nmen before they were aware\u2014one of them lying on the shore, and the\nother being in the boat. The fellow on shore was between sleeping and\n",
        "702": "waking, and going to start up; the captain, who was foremost, ran in\nupon him, and knocked him down; and then called out to him in the boat\nto yield, or he was a dead man. They needed very few arguments to\npersuade a single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him and his\ncomrade knocked down: besides, this was, it seems, one of the three who\nwere not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore\nwas easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to join very\nsincerely with us. In the meantime, Friday and the captain\u2019s mate so\nwell managed their business with the rest that they drew them, by\nhallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from one wood to\nanother, till they not only heartily tired them, but left them where\nthey were, very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it\nwas dark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, by the\ntime they came back to us.\n",
        "703": "We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to fall\nupon them, so as to make sure work with them. It was several hours\nafter Friday came back to me before they came back to their boat; and\nwe could hear the foremost of them, long before they came quite up,\ncalling to those behind to come along; and could also hear them answer,\nand complain how lame and tired they were, and not able to come any\nfaster: which was very welcome news to us. At length they came up to\nthe boat: but it is impossible to express their confusion when they\nfound the boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their\ntwo men gone. We could hear them call one to another in a most\n",
        "704": "lamentable manner, telling one another they were got into an enchanted\nisland; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they should all\nbe murdered, or else there were devils and spirits in it, and they\nshould be all carried away and devoured. They hallooed again, and\ncalled their two comrades by their names a great many times; but no\nanswer. After some time we could see them, by the little light there\nwas, run about, wringing their hands like men in despair, and sometimes\nthey would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves: then come\nashore again, and walk about again, and so the same thing over again.\n",
        "705": "My men would fain have had me give them leave to fall upon them at once\nin the dark; but I was willing to take them at some advantage, so as to\nspare them, and kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was\nunwilling to hazard the killing of any of our men, knowing the others\nwere very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not\nseparate; and therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade\nnearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands\nand feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they might not be\ndiscovered, and get as near them as they could possibly before they\noffered to fire.\nThey had not been long in that posture when the boatswain, who was the\nprincipal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown himself the most\ndejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them,\nwith two more of the crew; the captain was so eager at having this\nprincipal rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have\npatience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only\nheard his tongue before: but when they came nearer, the captain and\nFriday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them. The boatswain was\n",
        "706": "killed upon the spot: the next man was shot in the body, and fell just\nby him, though he did not die till an hour or two after; and the third\nran for it. At the noise of the fire I immediately advanced with my\nwhole army, which was now eight men, viz. myself, generalissimo;\nFriday, my lieutenant-general; the captain and his two men, and the\nthree prisoners of war whom we had trusted with arms. We came upon\n",
        "707": "them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our number; and I\nmade the man they had left in the boat, who was now one of us, to call\nthem by name, to try if I could bring them to a parley, and so perhaps\nmight reduce them to terms; which fell out just as we desired: for\nindeed it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they would be\nvery willing to capitulate. So he calls out as loud as he could to one\nof them, \u201cTom Smith! Tom Smith!\u201d Tom Smith answered immediately, \u201cIs\nthat Robinson?\u201d for it seems he knew the voice.

In a word, they all laid down their arms and begged\ntheir lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, and two\nmore, who bound them all; and then my great army of fifty men, which,\nwith those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon them,\nand upon their boat; only that I kept myself and one more out of sight\nfor reasons of state.\n",
        "711": "Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship:\nand as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he\nexpostulated with them upon the villainy of their practices with him,\nand upon the further wickedness of their design, and how certainly it\nmust bring them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the\ngallows. They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their\nlives. As for that, he told them they were not his prisoners, but the\ncommander\u2019s of the island; that they thought they had set him on shore\nin a barren, uninhabited island; but it had pleased God so to direct\nthem that it was inhabited, and that the governor was an Englishman;\nthat he might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he had given\nthem all quarter, he supposed he would send them to England, to be\ndealt with there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was\ncommanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death, for that he\nwould be hanged in the morning.\n",
        "712": "Though this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired\neffect; Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede with\nthe governor for his life; and all the rest begged of him, for God\u2019s\nsake, that they might not be sent to England.\nIt now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was come, and\nthat it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be\nhearty in getting possession of the ship; so I retired in the dark from\nthem, that they might not see what kind of a governor they had, and\ncalled the captain to me; when I called, at a good distance, one of the\nmen was ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, \u201cCaptain, the\ncommander calls for you;\u201d and presently the captain replied, \u201cTell his\nexcellency I am just coming.\u201d This more perfectly amazed them, and they\nall believed that the commander was just by, with his fifty men.

But, in order to execute it with more art, and to be\nsecure of success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he\nshould go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and send\nthem pinioned to the cave where the others lay.

The others I ordered to my\nbower, as I called it, of which I have given a full description: and as\nit was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was secure enough,\nconsidering they were upon their behaviour.\nTo these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a\nparley with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he\nthought they might be trusted or not to go on board and surprise the\nship. He talked to them of the injury done him, of the condition they\n",

This looked severe, and convinced them that the governor was in\nearnest; however, they had no way left them but to accept it; and it\nwas now the business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to\npersuade the other five to do their duty.\n",
        "717": "Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: first, the\ncaptain, his mate, and passenger; second, the two prisoners of the\nfirst gang, to whom, having their character from the captain, I had\ngiven their liberty, and trusted them with arms; third, the other two\nthat I had kept till now in my bower, pinioned, but on the captain\u2019s\nmotion had now released; fourth, these five released at last; so that\nthere were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave\nfor hostages.\nI asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on\nboard the ship; but as for me and my man Friday, I did not think it was\nproper for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it was\nemployment enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply them with\nvictuals. As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but\nFriday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with necessaries;\nand I made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where\nFriday was to take them.\n",
        "718": "When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the captain, who\ntold them I was the person the governor had ordered to look after them;\nand that it was the governor\u2019s pleasure they should not stir anywhere\nbut by my direction; that if they did, they would be fetched into the\ncastle, and be laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to see\nme as governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the\ngovernor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.\nThe captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish his two\nboats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made his passenger\ncaptain of one, with four of the men; and himself, his mate, and five\nmore, went in the other; and they contrived their business very well,\nfor they came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they came\n",
        "719": "within call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they\nhad brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time\nbefore they had found them, and the like, holding them in a chat till\nthey came to the ship\u2019s side; when the captain and the mate entering\nfirst with their arms, immediately knocked down the second mate and\ncarpenter with the butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully\nseconded by their men; they secured all the rest that were upon the\nmain and quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches, to keep them\ndown that were below; when the other boat and their men, entering at\nthe forechains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle\nwhich went down into the cook-room, making three men they found there\nprisoners. When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain\nordered the mate, with three men, to break into the round-house, where\nthe new rebel captain lay, who, having taken the alarm, had got up, and\nwith two men and a boy had got firearms in their hands; and when the\nmate, with a crow, split open the door, the new captain and his men\nfired boldly among them, and wounded the mate with a musket ball, which\nbroke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. The\nmate, calling for help, rushed, however, into the round-house, wounded\nas he was, and, with his pistol, shot the new captain through the head,\nthe bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again behind one of his\nears, so that he never spoke a word more: upon which the rest yielded,\nand the ship was taken effectually, without any more lives lost.\n",
        "720": "As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to\nbe fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of\nhis success, which, you may be sure, I was very glad to hear, having\nsat watching upon the shore for it till near two o\u2019clock in the\nmorning. Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it\nhaving been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I\nwas surprised with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I\nheard a man call me by the name of \u201cGovernor! Governor!\u201d and presently\nI knew the captain\u2019s voice; when, climbing up to the top of the hill,\nthere he stood, and, pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms,\n\u201cMy dear friend and deliverer,\u201d says he, \u201cthere\u2019s your ship; for she is\nall yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her.\u201d I cast my eyes\n",
        "721": "to the ship, and there she rode, within little more than half a mile of\nthe shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters\nof her, and, the weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor just\nagainst the mouth of the little creek; and the tide being up, the\ncaptain had brought the pinnace in near the place where I had first\nlanded my rafts, and so landed just at my door. I was at first ready to\nsink down with the surprise; for I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly\nput into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just ready to\ncarry me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for some time, I was\nnot able to answer him one word; but as he had taken me in his arms I\nheld fast by him, or I should have fallen to the ground. He perceived\n",
        "722": "the surprise, and immediately pulled a bottle out of his pocket and\ngave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me.\nAfter I had drunk it, I sat down upon the ground; and though it brought\nme to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to\nhim. All this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only\nnot under any surprise as I was; and he said a thousand kind and tender\nthings to me, to compose and bring me to myself; but such was the flood\nof joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion: at last\nit broke out into tears, and in a little while after I recovered my\nspeech; I then took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and we\nrejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a man sent by Heaven\n",
        "723": "to deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of\nwonders; that such things as these were the testimonies we had of a\nsecret hand of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the\neye of an infinite Power could search into the remotest corner of the\nworld, and send help to the miserable whenever He pleased. I forgot not\nto lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven; and what heart could\nforbear to bless Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner provided\nfor me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but from\nwhom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed.\nWhen we had talked a while, the captain told me he had brought me some\nlittle refreshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches\nthat had been so long his masters had not plundered him of. Upon this,\n",
        "724": "he called aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore\nthat were for the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had\nbeen one that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I had\nbeen to dwell upon the island still. First, he had brought me a case of\nbottles full of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira\nwine (the bottles held two quarts each), two pounds of excellent good\ntobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship\u2019s beef, and six pieces of pork,\nwith a bag of peas, and about a hundred-weight of biscuit; he also\nbrought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and\ntwo bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of other things. But besides\nthese, and what was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me\nsix new clean shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one\npair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good suit\nof clothes of his own, which had been worn but very little: in a word,\nhe clothed me from head to foot. It was a very kind and agreeable\n",

Upon this, I told him that, if he desired it, I would\nundertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own request\nthat he should leave them upon the island. \u201cI should be very glad of\n",

I let them know that by my direction the ship had been\nseized; that she lay now in the road; and they might see by-and-by that\ntheir new captain had received the reward of his villainy, and that\nthey would see him hanging at the yard-arm; that, as to them, I wanted\nto know what they had to say why I should not execute them as pirates\ntaken in the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt but I had\nauthority so to do.\n",
        "728": "One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing to\nsay but this, that when they were taken the captain promised them their\nlives, and they humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I knew not\nwhat mercy to show them; for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the\nisland with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain to go to\nEngland; and as for the captain, he could not carry them to England\nother than as prisoners in irons, to be tried for mutiny and running\naway with the ship; the consequence of which, they must needs know,\nwould be the gallows; so that I could not tell what was best for them,\nunless they had a mind to take their fate in the island.

Upon this they appeared very\nthankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire\ninto the woods, to the place whence they came, and I would leave them\nsome firearms, some ammunition, and some directions how they should\nlive very well if they thought fit. Upon this I prepared to go on board\nthe ship; but told the captain I would stay that night to prepare my\nthings, and desired him to go on board in the meantime, and keep all\nright in the ship, and send the boat on shore next day for me; ordering\nhim, at all events, to cause the new captain, who was killed, to be\nhanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see him.\n",
        "731": "When the captain was gone I sent for the men up to me to my apartment,\nand entered seriously into discourse with them on their circumstances.\nI told them I thought they had made a right choice; that if the captain\nhad carried them away they would certainly be hanged.

        "732": "When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told them\nI would let them into the story of my living there, and put them into\nthe way of making it easy to them. Accordingly, I gave them the whole\nhistory of the place, and of my coming to it; showed them my\nfortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my\ngrapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I\ntold them the story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were to be\nexpected, for whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them\nin common with themselves.

Upon this the captain pretended to have no\npower without me; but after some difficulty, and after their solemn\npromises of amendment, they were taken on board, and were, some time\nafter, soundly whipped and pickled; after which they proved very honest\nand quiet fellows.\nSome time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being up,\nwith the things promised to the men; to which the captain, at my\nintercession, caused their chests and clothes to be added, which they\ntook, and were very thankful for. I also encouraged them, by telling\n",

My benefactor and faithful steward,\nwhom I had left my money in trust with, was alive, but had had great\nmisfortunes in the world; was become a widow the second time, and very\nlow in the world.

I went down afterwards into\nYorkshire; but my father was dead, and my mother and all the family\nextinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the children of\none of my brothers; and as I had been long ago given over for dead,\nthere had been no provision made for me; so that, in a word, I found\nnothing to relieve or assist me; and that the little money I had would\nnot do much for me as to settling in the world.\nI met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I did not expect; and\nthis was, that the master of the ship, whom I had so happily delivered,\nand by the same means saved the ship and cargo, having given a very\nhandsome account to the owners of the manner how I had saved the lives\nof the men and the ship, they invited me to meet them and some other\nmerchants concerned, and all together made me a very handsome\ncompliment upon the subject, and a present of almost \u00a3200 sterling.\n",
        "740": "But after making several reflections upon the circumstances of my life,\nand how little way this would go towards settling me in the world, I\nresolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come at some\ninformation of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what\nwas become of my partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some years\npast given me over for dead. With this view I took shipping for Lisbon,\nwhere I arrived in April following, my man Friday accompanying me very\nhonestly in all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant\nupon all occasions. When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and\nto my particular satisfaction, my old friend, the captain of the ship\nwho first took me up at sea off the shore of Africa. He was now grown\n",

        "742": "After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between us, I\ninquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my partner. The old\nman told me he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but\nthat he could assure me that when he came away my partner was living,\nbut the trustees whom I had joined with him to take cognisance of my\npart were both dead: that, however, he believed I would have a very\ngood account of the improvement of the plantation; for that, upon the\ngeneral belief of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given\nin the account of the produce of my part of the plantation to the\nprocurator-fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case I never came to\nclaim it, one-third to the king, and two-thirds to the monastery of St.\nAugustine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the\nconversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith: but that, if I\nappeared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it would be\nrestored; only that the improvement, or annual production, being\ndistributed to charitable uses, could not be restored: but he assured\nme that the steward of the king\u2019s revenue from lands, and the\nprovidore, or steward of the monastery, had taken great care all along\nthat the incumbent, that is to say my partner, gave every year a\nfaithful account of the produce, of which they had duly received my\nmoiety. I asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he had\n",
        "743": "brought the plantation, and whether he thought it might be worth\nlooking after; or whether, on my going thither, I should meet with any\nobstruction to my possessing my just right in the moiety. He told me he\ncould not tell exactly to what degree the plantation was improved; but\nthis he knew, that my partner was grown exceeding rich upon the\nenjoying his part of it; and that, to the best of his remembrance, he\nhad heard that the king\u2019s third of my part, which was, it seems,\ngranted away to some other monastery or religious house, amounted to\nabove two hundred moidores a year: that as to my being restored to a\nquiet possession of it, there was no question to be made of that, my\npartner being alive to witness my title, and my name being also\nenrolled in the register of the country; also he told me that the\nsurvivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest people, and very\nwealthy; and he believed I would not only have their assistance for\nputting me in possession, but would find a very considerable sum of\nmoney in their hands for my account, being the produce of the farm\nwhile their fathers held the trust, and before it was given up, as\nabove; which, as he remembered, was for about twelve years.\nI showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and\ninquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees\nshould thus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had made my\nwill, and had made him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c.\n",
        "744": "He told me that was true; but that as there was no proof of my being\ndead, he could not act as executor until some certain account should\ncome of my death; and, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with\na thing so remote: that it was true he had registered my will, and put\nin his claim; and could he have given any account of my being dead or\nalive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the\ningenio (so they call the sugar-house), and have given his son, who was\nnow at the Brazils, orders to do it. \u201cBut,\u201d says the old man, \u201cI have\none piece of news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable\nto you as the rest; and that is, believing you were lost, and all the\nworld believing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account\nwith me, in your name, for the first six or eight years\u2019 profits, which\nI received. There being at that time great disbursements for increasing\nthe works, building an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to\nnear so much as afterwards it produced; however,\u201d says the old man, \u201cI\nshall give you a true account of what I have received in all, and how I\nhave disposed of it.\u201d\n",

He told me he could not\nsay but it might straiten him a little; but, however, it was my money,\nand I might want it more than he.\nEverything the good man said was full of affection, and I could hardly\nrefrain from tears while he spoke; in short, I took one hundred of the\nmoidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them:\nthen I returned him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of\nthe plantation I would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I\nafterwards did); and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his\nson\u2019s ship, I would not take it by any means; but that if I wanted the\nmoney, I found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but\ncame to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a\npenny more from him.\n",

He said I might do so if I pleased, but that if I\ndid not, there were ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to\nappropriate the profits to my use: and as there were ships in the river\nof Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in\na public register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon oath, that I was\nalive, and that I was the same person who took up the land for the\nplanting the said plantation at first.

In a word, I was so prepossessed\nagainst my going by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I\nresolved to travel all the way by land; which, as I was not in haste,\nand did not value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way: and to\nmake it more so, my old captain brought an English gentleman, the son\nof a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me; after which\nwe picked up two more English merchants also, and two young Portuguese\ngentlemen, the last going to Paris only; so that in all there were six\nof us and five servants; the two merchants and the two Portuguese,\ncontenting themselves with one servant between two, to save the charge;\nand as for me, I got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant,\nbesides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of\nsupplying the place of a servant on the road.\n",

But, while I was considering\nthis, there came in four French gentlemen, who, having been stopped on\nthe French side of the passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out\na guide, who, traversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had\nbrought them over the mountains by such ways that they were not much\nincommoded with the snow; for where they met with snow in any quantity,\nthey said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their horses. We\nsent for this guide, who told us he would undertake to carry us the\nsame way, with no hazard from the snow, provided we were armed\nsufficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts; for, he said, in\nthese great snows it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at\nthe foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of food, the\nground being covered with snow.

        "767": "But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I; and, indeed,\nit alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of Friday\u2019s pistol, we\nheard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves; and the noise,\nredoubled by the echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had\nbeen a prodigious number of them; and perhaps there was not such a few\nas that we had no cause of apprehension: however, as Friday had killed\nthis wolf, the other that had fastened upon the horse left him\nimmediately, and fled, without doing him any damage, having happily\nfastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his\nteeth. But the man was most hurt; for the raging creature had bit him\ntwice, once in the arm, and the other time a little above his knee; and\nthough he had made some defence, he was just tumbling down by the\ndisorder of his horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf.\nIt is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday\u2019s pistol we all\nmended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very\ndifficult, would give us leave, to see what was the matter.

FIGHT BETWEEN FRIDAY AND A BEAR\nBut never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising\nmanner as that which followed between Friday and the bear, which gave\nus all, though at first we were surprised and afraid for him, the\ngreatest diversion imaginable.

We were\nall a little surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it was\neasy to see joy and courage in the fellow\u2019s countenance. \u201cO! O! O!\u201d\n",

Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up\nwith him quickly, and took up a great stone, and threw it at him, and\nhit him just on the head, but did him no more harm than if he had\nthrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday\u2019s end, for the rogue\nwas so void of fear that he did it purely to make the bear follow him,\nand show us some laugh as he called it. As soon as the bear felt the\nblow, and saw him, he turns about and comes after him, taking very long\nstrides, and shuffling on at a strange rate, so as would have put a\nhorse to a middling gallop; away runs Friday, and takes his course as\nif he ran towards us for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon\nthe bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at him for bringing\nthe bear back upon us, when he was going about his own business another\nway; and especially I was angry that he had turned the bear upon us,\nand then ran away; and I called out, \u201cYou dog! is this your making us\n",

Come away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the creature.\u201d\nHe heard me, and cried out, \u201cNo shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you\nget much laugh:\u201d and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the bear\u2019s\none, he turned on a sudden on one side of us, and seeing a great\noak-tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to follow; and doubling\nhis pace, he got nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the\nground, at about five or six yards from the bottom of the tree. The\nbear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance: the first\nthing he did he stopped at the gun, smelt at it, but let it lie, and up\nhe scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous\nheavy.

But Friday had not done with\nhim by a great deal; when seeing him stand still, he called out to him\nagain, as if he had supposed the bear could speak English, \u201cWhat, you\ncome no farther? pray you come farther;\u201d so he left jumping and shaking\nthe tree; and the bear, just as if he understood what he said, did come\na little farther; then he began jumping again, and the bear stopped\nagain.

Oh, pray! no shoot, me shoot by and\nthen:\u201d he would have said by-and-by. However, to shorten the story,\nFriday danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had\nlaughing enough, but still could not imagine what the fellow would do:\nfor first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear off; and we\nfound the bear was too cunning for that too; for he would not go out\nfar enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with his great broad claws\nand feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the end of it, and\nwhat the jest would be at last. But Friday put us out of doubt quickly:\n",
        "777": "for seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be\npersuaded to come any farther, \u201cWell, well,\u201d says Friday, \u201cyou no come\nfarther, me go; you no come to me, me come to you;\u201d and upon this he\nwent out to the smaller end, where it would bend with his weight, and\ngently let himself down by it, sliding down the bough till he came near\nenough to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, took it\nup, and stood still. \u201cWell,\u201d said I to him, \u201cFriday, what will you do\nnow? Why don\u2019t you shoot him?\u201d \u201cNo shoot,\u201d says Friday, \u201cno yet; me\nshoot now, me no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh:\u201d and, indeed,\nso he did; for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he came back from the\nbough, where he stood, but did it very cautiously, looking behind him\nevery step, and coming backward till he got into the body of the tree,\nthen, with the same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree,\ngrasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very\nleisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind foot\n",

        "783": "wolves howl in the wood on our left in a frightful manner, and\npresently after we saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us,\nall in a body, and most of them in a line, as regularly as an army\ndrawn up by experienced officers. I scarce knew in what manner to\nreceive them, but found to draw ourselves in a close line was the only\nway; so we formed in a moment; but that we might not have too much\ninterval, I ordered that only every other man should fire, and that the\nothers, who had not fired, should stand ready to give them a second\nvolley immediately, if they continued to advance upon us; and then that\nthose that had fired at first should not pretend to load their fusees\nagain, but stand ready, every one with a pistol, for we were all armed\nwith a fusee and a pair of pistols each man; so we were, by this\nmethod, able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time; however, at\npresent we had no necessity; for upon firing the first volley, the\nenemy made a full stop, being terrified as well with the noise as with\nthe fire. Four of them being shot in the head, dropped; several others\nwere wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could see by the snow. I\n",
        "784": "found they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon,\nremembering that I had been told that the fiercest creatures were\nterrified at the voice of a man, I caused all the company to halloo as\nloud as they could; and I found the notion not altogether mistaken; for\nupon our shout they began to retire and turn about. I then ordered a\nsecond volley to be fired in their rear, which put them to the gallop,\nand away they went to the woods. This gave us leisure to charge our\npieces again; and that we might lose no time, we kept going; but we had\nbut little more than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness,\nwhen we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left, only that\nit was farther onward, the same way we were to go.\n",
        "785": "The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, which made it\nworse on our side; but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive\nthat it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures; and on\na sudden we perceived three troops of wolves, one on our left, one\nbehind us, and one in our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded\nwith them: however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way\nforward, as fast as we could make our horses go, which, the way being\nvery rough, was only a good hard trot. In this manner, we came in view\nof the entrance of a wood, through which we were to pass, at the\nfarther side of the plain; but we were greatly surprised, when coming\nnearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing\njust at the entrance. On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we\nheard the noise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a horse,\nwith a saddle and a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or\nseventeen wolves after him, full speed: the horse had the advantage of\nthem; but as we supposed that he could not hold it at that rate, we\ndoubted not but they would get up with him at last: no question but\nthey did.\n",
        "786": "But here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the entrance\nwhere the horse came out, we found the carcasses of another horse and\nof two men, devoured by the ravenous creatures; and one of the men was\nno doubt the same whom we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just\nby him fired off; but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his\nbody was eaten up. This filled us with horror, and we knew not what\ncourse to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered\nabout us presently, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were\nthree hundred of them. It happened, very much to our advantage, that at\nthe entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there lay some\nlarge timber-trees, which had been cut down the summer before, and I\nsuppose lay there for carriage. I drew my little troop in among those\n",
        "787": "trees, and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I advised\nthem all to alight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork,\nto stand in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our horses in the\ncentre. We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a more furious\ncharge than the creatures made upon us in this place. They came on with\na growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I\nsaid, was our breastwork, as if they were only rushing upon their prey;\nand this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their\nseeing our horses behind us. I ordered our men to fire as before, every\n",
        "788": "other man; and they took their aim so sure that they killed several of\nthe wolves at the first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a\ncontinual firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on\nthose before.\nWhen we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought they\nstopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off, but it was but\na moment, for others came forward again; so we fired two volleys of our\npistols; and I believe in these four firings we had killed seventeen or\neighteen of them, and lamed twice as many, yet they came on again. I\nwas loth to spend our shot too hastily; so I called my servant, not my\nman Friday, for he was better employed, for, with the greatest\ndexterity imaginable, he had charged my fusee and his own while we were\nengaged\u2014but, as I said, I called my other man, and giving him a horn of\npowder, I had him lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it\nbe a large train. He did so, and had but just time to get away, when\n",
        "789": "the wolves came up to it, and some got upon it, when I, snapping an\nuncharged pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; those that were\nupon the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell;\nor rather jumped in among us with the force and fright of the fire; we\ndespatched these in an instant, and the rest were so frightened with\nthe light, which the night\u2014for it was now very near dark\u2014made more\nterrible that they drew back a little; upon which I ordered our last\npistols to be fired off in one volley, and after that we gave a shout;\nupon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near\ntwenty lame ones that we found struggling on the ground, and fell to\ncutting them with our swords, which answered our expectation, for the\ncrying and howling they made was better understood by their fellows; so\nthat they all fled and left us.\nWe had, first and last, killed about threescore of them, and had it\nbeen daylight we had killed many more. The field of battle being thus\ncleared, we made forward again, for we had still near a league to go.\n",
        "790": "We heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went\nseveral times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them; but the\nsnow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain. In about an hour more we\ncame to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible\nfright and all in arms; for, it seems, the night before the wolves and\nsome bears had broken into the village, and put them in such terror\nthat they were obliged to keep guard night and day, but especially in\nthe night, to preserve their cattle, and indeed their people.\nThe next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much\nwith the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther; so we\nwere obliged to take a new guide here, and go to Toulouse, where we\nfound a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and no snow, no\nwolves, nor anything like them; but when we told our story at Toulouse,\nthey told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest\nat the foot of the mountains, especially when the snow lay on the\nground; but they inquired much what kind of guide we had got who would\nventure to bring us that way in such a severe season, and told us it\nwas surprising we were not all devoured. When we told them how we\n",
        "791": "placed ourselves and the horses in the middle, they blamed us\nexceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all\ndestroyed, for it was the sight of the horses which made the wolves so\nfurious, seeing their prey, and that at other times they are really\nafraid of a gun; but being excessively hungry, and raging on that\naccount, the eagerness to come at the horses had made them senseless of\ndanger, and that if we had not by the continual fire, and at last by\nthe stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it had been great\nodds but that we had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been content\nto have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not\nhave taken the horses so much for their own, when men were on their\nbacks, as otherwise; and withal, they told us that at last, if we had\nstood altogether, and left our horses, they would have been so eager to\nhave devoured them, that we might have come off safe, especially having\nour firearms in our hands, being so many in number. For my part, I was\nnever so sensible of danger in my life; for, seeing above three hundred\ndevils come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing\nto shelter us or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as it\nwas, I believe I shall never care to cross those mountains again: I\nthink I would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I was\nsure to meet with a storm once a-week.\nI have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through\nFrance\u2014nothing but what other travellers have given an account of with\nmuch more advantage than I can. I travelled from Toulouse to Paris, and\n",
        "792": "without any considerable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover\nthe 14th of January, after having had a severe cold season to travel\nin.\nI was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little time\nall my new-discovered estate safe about me, the bills of exchange which\nI brought with me having been currently paid.\nMy principal guide and privy-counsellor was my good ancient widow, who,\nin gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought no pains too much\nnor care too great to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely that\nI was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects; and, indeed, I\nwas very happy from the beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted\nintegrity of this good gentlewoman.\n",
        "793": "And now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation in the Brazils, I\nwrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who, having offered it to the two\nmerchants, the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, they\naccepted the offer, and remitted thirty-three thousand pieces of eight\nto a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.\nIn return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which they sent\nfrom Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me the bills of\nexchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight for the\nestate, reserving the payment of one hundred moidores a year to him\n(the old man) during his life, and fifty moidores afterwards to his son\nfor his life, which I had promised them, and which the plantation was\nto make good as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first part of\na life of fortune and adventure\u2014a life of Providence\u2019s chequer-work,\nand of a variety which the world will seldom be able to show the like\nof; beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily than any part of\nit ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.\n",
        "794": "Any one would think that in this state of complicated good fortune I\nwas past running any more hazards\u2014and so, indeed, I had been, if other\ncircumstances had concurred; but I was inured to a wandering life, had\nno family, nor many relations; nor, however rich, had I contracted\nfresh acquaintance; and though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet\nI could not keep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to\nbe upon the wing again; especially I could not resist the strong\ninclination I had to see my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards\nwere in being there. My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me\nfrom it, and so far prevailed with me, that for almost seven years she\nprevented my running abroad, during which time I took my two nephews,\nthe children of one of my brothers, into my care; the eldest, having\nsomething of his own, I bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a\nsettlement of some addition to his estate after my decease. The other I\nplaced with the captain of a ship; and after five years, finding him a\nsensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good ship,\nand sent him to sea; and this young fellow afterwards drew me in, as\nold as I was, to further adventures myself.\n",
        "795": "In the meantime, I in part settled myself here; for, first of all, I\nmarried, and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and\nhad three children, two sons and one daughter; but my wife dying, and\nmy nephew coming home with good success from a voyage to Spain, my\ninclination to go abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and engaged\nme to go in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies; this was\nin the year 1694.\nIn this voyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my successors\nthe Spaniards, had the old story of their lives and of the villains I\nleft there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, how they\nafterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at last the\nSpaniards were obliged to use violence with them; how they were\nsubjected to the Spaniards, how honestly the Spaniards used them\u2014a\nhistory, if it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful\naccidents as my own part\u2014particularly, also, as to their battles with\nthe Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the island, and as to the\nimprovement they made upon the island itself, and how five of them made\nan attempt upon the mainland, and brought away eleven men and five\nwomen prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty young\nchildren on the island.\nHere I stayed about twenty days, left them supplies of all necessary\nthings, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two\nworkmen, which I had brought from England with me, viz. a carpenter and\n",
        "796": "a smith.\nBesides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, reserved to\nmyself the property of the whole, but gave them such parts respectively\nas they agreed on; and having settled all things with them, and engaged\nthem not to leave the place, I left them there.\nFrom thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a bark, which\nI bought there, with more people to the island; and in it, besides\nother supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I found proper for\nservice, or for wives to such as would take them. As to the Englishmen,\n",
        "797": "I promised to send them some women from England, with a good cargo of\nnecessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting\u2014which I\nafterwards could not perform. The fellows proved very honest and\ndiligent after they were mastered and had their properties set apart\nfor them. I sent them, also, from the Brazils, five cows, three of them\nbeing big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs, which when I came again\nwere considerably increased.\n",
        "798": "But all these things, with an account how three hundred Caribbees came\nand invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how they fought\nwith that whole number twice, and were at first defeated, and one of\nthem killed; but at last, a storm destroying their enemies\u2019 canoes,\nthey famished or destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and\nrecovered the possession of their plantation, and still lived upon the\nisland.\nAll these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new\nadventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give a farther\naccount of in the Second Part of my Story.\n"
