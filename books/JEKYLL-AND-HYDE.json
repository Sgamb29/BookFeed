It is the mark of a modest man to accept\n",
        "6": "his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that\nwas the lawyer\u2019s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those\nwhom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the\ngrowth of time, they implied no aptness in the object.

Even on Sunday,\nwhen it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of\npassage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood,\nlike a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters,\nwell-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note,\ninstantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger.\nTwo doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was\nbroken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain\nsinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street.

The\ndoor, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered\nand distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on\nthe panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried\nhis knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had\nappeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their\nravages.\n",

        "18": "mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the\nquestion, we did the next best.

The figure was stiff; but the\nsignature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took\nthe liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business\nlooked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a\ncellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man\u2019s\ncheque for close upon a hundred pounds.

        "24": "\u201cI see you feel as I do,\u201d said Mr. Enfield. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a bad story. For\nmy man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really\ndamnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of\nthe proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your\nfellows who do what they call good. Blackmail, I suppose; an honest man\npaying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail\n",
        "25": "House is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though\neven that, you know, is far from explaining all,\u201d he added, and with\nthe words fell into a vein of musing.\nFrom this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: \u201cAnd\n",
        "26": "you don\u2019t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?\u201d\n\u201cA likely place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d returned Mr. Enfield. \u201cBut I happen to have\nnoticed his address; he lives in some square or other.\u201d\n",
        "27": "\u201cAnd you never asked about the\u2014place with the door?\u201d said Mr. Utterson.\n\u201cNo, sir; I had a delicacy,\u201d was the reply. \u201cI feel very strongly about\nputting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of\njudgment. You start a question, and it\u2019s like starting a stone. You sit\n",

No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks\nlike Queer Street, the less I ask.\u201d\n\u201cA very good rule, too,\u201d said the lawyer.\n",
        "29": "\u201cBut I have studied the place for myself,\u201d continued Mr. Enfield. \u201cIt\nseems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or\nout of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my\nadventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first\n",
        "30": "floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they\u2019re clean. And\nthen there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must\nlive there. And yet it\u2019s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed\ntogether about the court, that it\u2019s hard to say where one ends and\nanother begins.\u201d\n",
        "31": "The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then \u201cEnfield,\u201d\nsaid Mr. Utterson, \u201cthat\u2019s a good rule of yours.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I think it is,\u201d returned Enfield.\n\u201cBut for all that,\u201d continued the lawyer, \u201cthere\u2019s one point I want to\nask. I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.\u201d\n",
        "32": "\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Enfield, \u201cI can\u2019t see what harm it would do. It was a\nman of the name of Hyde.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d said Mr. Utterson. \u201cWhat sort of a man is he to see?\u201d\n",
        "33": "\u201cHe is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his\nappearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I\nnever saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be\n",
        "34": "deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I\ncouldn\u2019t specify the point. He\u2019s an extraordinary looking man, and yet\nI really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand\nof it; I can\u2019t describe him. And it\u2019s not want of memory; for I declare\n",
        "35": "I can see him this moment.\u201d\nMr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a\nweight of consideration. \u201cYou are sure he used a key?\u201d he inquired at\n",
        "36": "last.\n\u201cMy dear sir...\u201d began Enfield, surprised out of himself.\n\u201cYes, I know,\u201d said Utterson; \u201cI know it must seem strange. The fact\n",
        "37": "is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I\nknow it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have\nbeen inexact in any point you had better correct it.\u201d\n\u201cI think you might have warned me,\u201d returned the other with a touch of\nsullenness. \u201cBut I have been pedantically exact, as you call it.

        "39": "presently resumed. \u201cHere is another lesson to say nothing,\u201d said he. \u201cI\nam ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to\nthis again.\u201d\n",
        "40": "\u201cWith all my heart,\u201d said the lawyer. \u201cI shake hands on that, Richard.\u201d\nSEARCH FOR MR. HYDE\nThat evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre\n",

This document had long been the lawyer\u2019s eyesore.\nIt offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and\ncustomary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And\nhitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his\n",
        "45": "indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was\nalready bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn\nno more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable\nattributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so\nlong baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment\nof a fiend.\n",
        "46": "\u201cI thought it was madness,\u201d he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper\nin the safe, \u201cand now I begin to fear it is disgrace.\u201d\nWith that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in\nthe direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his\nfriend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding\npatients. \u201cIf anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,\u201d he had thought.\n",
        "47": "The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage\nof delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr.\nLanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper,\nred-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a\nboisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up\n",
        "48": "from his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was\nthe way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed\non genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at\nschool and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each\nother, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each\nother\u2019s company.\n",
        "49": "After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so\ndisagreeably preoccupied his mind.\n\u201cI suppose, Lanyon,\u201d said he, \u201cyou and I must be the two oldest friends\nthat Henry Jekyll has?\u201d\n\u201cI wish the friends were younger,\u201d chuckled Dr. Lanyon. \u201cBut I suppose\n",

        "52": "This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.\n\u201cThey have only differed on some point of science,\u201d he thought; and\nbeing a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of\nconveyancing), he even added: \u201cIt is nothing worse than that!\u201d He gave\nhis friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached\nthe question he had come to put. \u201cDid you ever come across a _prot\u00e9g\u00e9_\nof his\u2014one Hyde?\u201d he asked.\n",
        "53": "\u201cHyde?\u201d repeated Lanyon. \u201cNo. Never heard of him. Since my time.\u201d\nThat was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with\nhim to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the\nsmall hours of the morning began to grow large.

        "54": "Six o\u2019clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently\nnear to Mr. Utterson\u2019s dwelling, and still he was digging at the\nproblem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone;\nbut now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he\nlay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained\nroom, Mr. Enfield\u2019s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted\n",

And still the figure had no face by which he might know\nit; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and\nmelted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew\napace in the lawyer\u2019s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate,\ncuriosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but\nonce set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps\nroll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well\nexamined.

The lawyer liked\nthis letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he\nhad looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.\n",
        "136": "\u201cHave you the envelope?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI burned it,\u201d replied Jekyll, \u201cbefore I thought what I was about. But\nit bore no postmark. The note was handed in.\u201d\n",

And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies,\nwhich led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and\nshed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my\nmembers. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the\nmoral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth,\nby whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful\nshipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two.
