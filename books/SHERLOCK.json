        "3": "were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\nwas, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\nthe world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\nfalse position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\nand a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer\u2014excellent for\n",
        "4": "drawing the veil from men\u2019s motives and actions. But for the trained\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\nthrow a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\n",
        "5": "yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\nAdler, of dubious and questionable memory.\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\nfrom each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\n",
        "6": "interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\nwhile Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\nsoul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\nbooks, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\nthe drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\nnature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\nand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\nobservation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\nmysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\nFrom time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\nsummons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\nof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\n",

As I passed the well-remembered\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\nwith the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\nextraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\n",
        "8": "looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\nagainst the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\nstory. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\n",
        "9": "dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\nand was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\n",
        "10": "to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\nand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\n",
        "11": "\u201cWedlock suits you,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think, Watson, that you have put\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\u201d\n\u201cSeven!\u201d I answered.\n",
        "12": "\u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\nthat you intended to go into harness.\u201d\n",
        "13": "\u201cThen, how do you know?\u201d\n\u201cI see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\nservant girl?\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Holmes,\u201d said I, \u201cthis is too much. You would certainly have\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\n",
        "14": "country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\nhave changed my clothes I can\u2019t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out.\u201d\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n",
        "15": "\u201cIt is simplicity itself,\u201d said he; \u201cmy eyes tell me that on the inside\nof your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\nscored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\norder to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\ndeduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\n",
        "16": "to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\niodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\nforefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\u201d\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\nprocess of deduction. \u201cWhen I hear you give your reasons,\u201d I remarked,\n\u201cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\nreasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\n",
        "17": "believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so,\u201d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\ndown into an armchair. \u201cYou see, but you do not observe. The\ndistinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\n",
        "18": "which lead up from the hall to this room.\u201d\n\u201cFrequently.\u201d\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\n\u201cWell, some hundreds of times.\u201d\n",
        "19": "\u201cThen how many are there?\u201d\n\u201cHow many? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\nmy point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\n",
        "20": "both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\u201d He threw\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\nupon the table. \u201cIt came by the last post,\u201d said he. \u201cRead it aloud.\u201d\n",
        "21": "The note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n\u201cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\u2019clock,\u201d it\nsaid, \u201ca gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\ndeepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\nEurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\n",
        "22": "This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\nwear a mask.\u201d\n\u201cThis is indeed a mystery,\u201d I remarked. \u201cWhat do you imagine that it\n",
        "23": "means?\u201d\n\u201cI have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\ndata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\ntheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\n",
        "24": "it?\u201d\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\nwritten.\n\u201cThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\u201d I remarked,\nendeavouring to imitate my companion\u2019s processes. \u201cSuch paper could not\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\n",
        "25": "stiff.\u201d\n\u201cPeculiar\u2014that is the very word,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cIt is not an English\npaper at all. Hold it up to the light.\u201d\n",
        "26": "I did so, and saw a large \u201cE\u201d with a small \u201cg,\u201d a \u201cP,\u201d and a large \u201cG\u201d\nwith a small \u201ct\u201d woven into the texture of the paper.\n\u201cWhat do you make of that?\u201d asked Holmes.\n\u201cThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\u201d\n",

        "29": "as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\nglass-factories and paper-mills.\u2019 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\nthat?\u201d His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\nfrom his cigarette.\n\u201cThe paper was made in Bohemia,\u201d I said.\n",
        "30": "\u201cPrecisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\npeculiar construction of the sentence\u2014\u2018This account of you we have from\nall quarters received.\u2019 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\nthat. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\n",
        "31": "remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\nwrites upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\nface. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\ndoubts.\u201d\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\u2019 hoofs and grating\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\n",
        "32": "whistled.\n\u201cA pair, by the sound,\u201d said he. \u201cYes,\u201d he continued, glancing out of\nthe window. \u201cA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\n",
        "33": "and fifty guineas apiece. There\u2019s money in this case, Watson, if there\nis nothing else.\u201d\n\u201cI think that I had better go, Holmes.\u201d\n",
        "34": "\u201cNot a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\nAnd this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\u201d\n\u201cBut your client\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNever mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\n",
        "35": "Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\u201d\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\nauthoritative tap.\n",
        "36": "\u201cCome in!\u201d said Holmes.\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\nin height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\nwith a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\ntaste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\n",
        "37": "fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\nthrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\nsecured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\nberyl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\ntrimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\nbarbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\ncarried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\nwas still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\n",
        "38": "he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\nand a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\nof obstinacy.\n\u201cYou had my note?\u201d he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\nmarked German accent. \u201cI told you that I would call.\u201d He looked from\none to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\n",
        "39": "\u201cPray take a seat,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis is my friend and colleague, Dr.\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\nhave I the honour to address?\u201d\n\u201cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\n",
        "40": "understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\ndiscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\nimportance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\nalone.\u201d\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\nmy chair. \u201cIt is both, or none,\u201d said he. \u201cYou may say before this\n",
        "41": "gentleman anything which you may say to me.\u201d\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cThen I must begin,\u201d said he,\n\u201cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\n",
        "42": "much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\nEuropean history.\u201d\n\u201cI promise,\u201d said Holmes.\n\u201cAnd I.\u201d\n",
        "43": "\u201cYou will excuse this mask,\u201d continued our strange visitor. \u201cThe august\nperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\nconfess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\nnot exactly my own.\u201d\n\u201cI was aware of it,\u201d said Holmes dryly.\n",
        "44": "\u201cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\nbe taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\nseriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\nplainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\nkings of Bohemia.\u201d\n\u201cI was also aware of that,\u201d murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\nhis armchair and closing his eyes.\n",
        "45": "Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\nmost incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\n\u201cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\u201d he remarked, \u201cI\nshould be better able to advise you.\u201d\n",
        "46": "The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\nthe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \u201cYou are right,\u201d\nhe cried; \u201cI am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\u201d\n",
        "47": "\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201d murmured Holmes. \u201cYour Majesty had not spoken before I\nwas aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\nBohemia.\u201d\n\u201cBut you can understand,\u201d said our strange visitor, sitting down once\nmore and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \u201cyou can\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\nperson. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\n",
        "48": "an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_\nfrom Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\u201d\n\u201cThen, pray consult,\u201d said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\n",
        "49": "\u201cThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\nvisit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,\nIrene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\u201d\n\u201cKindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\u201d murmured Holmes without\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\nall paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to\nname a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\ninformation. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\n",
        "50": "that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\nmonograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\n\u201cLet me see!\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.\nContralto\u2014hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw\u2014yes!\nRetired from operatic stage\u2014ha! Living in London\u2014quite so! Your\nMajesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,\nwrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting\nthose letters back.\u201d\n",
        "51": "\u201cPrecisely so. But how\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWas there a secret marriage?\u201d\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\u201cNo legal papers or certificates?\u201d\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n",
        "52": "\u201cThen I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\nprove their authenticity?\u201d\n\u201cThere is the writing.\u201d\n\u201cPooh, pooh! Forgery.\u201d\n",
        "53": "\u201cMy private note-paper.\u201d\n\u201cStolen.\u201d\n\u201cMy own seal.\u201d\n",
        "54": "\u201cImitated.\u201d\n\u201cMy photograph.\u201d\n\u201cBought.\u201d\n",
        "55": "\u201cWe were both in the photograph.\u201d\n\u201cOh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\nindiscretion.\u201d\n\u201cI was mad\u2014insane.\u201d\n",
        "56": "\u201cYou have compromised yourself seriously.\u201d\n\u201cI was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\u201d\n\u201cIt must be recovered.\u201d\n",
        "57": "\u201cWe have tried and failed.\u201d\n\u201cYour Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\u201d\n\u201cShe will not sell.\u201d\n",
        "58": "\u201cStolen, then.\u201d\n\u201cFive attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\nhouse. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has\n",
        "59": "been waylaid. There has been no result.\u201d\n\u201cNo sign of it?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely none.\u201d\nHolmes laughed. \u201cIt is quite a pretty little problem,\u201d said he.\n",
        "60": "\u201cBut a very serious one to me,\u201d returned the King reproachfully.\n\u201cVery, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\u201d\n\u201cTo ruin me.\u201d\n",
        "61": "\u201cBut how?\u201d\n\u201cI am about to be married.\u201d\n\u201cSo I have heard.\u201d\n\u201cTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is\n",
        "62": "herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\nwould bring the matter to an end.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Irene Adler?\u201d\n\u201cThreatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that\n",
        "63": "she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She\nhas the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most\nresolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no\nlengths to which she would not go\u2014none.\u201d\n",
        "64": "\u201cYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?\u201d\n\u201cI am sure.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause she has said that she would send it on the day when the\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\u201d\n\u201cOh, then we have three days yet,\u201d said Holmes with a yawn. \u201cThat is\n",
        "65": "very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into\njust at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the\npresent?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count\nVon Kramm.\u201d\n",
        "66": "\u201cThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\u201d\n\u201cPray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\u201d\n\u201cThen, as to money?\u201d\n\u201cYou have _carte blanche_.\u201d\n",
        "67": "\u201cAbsolutely?\u201d\n\u201cI tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to\nhave that photograph.\u201d\n\u201cAnd for present expenses?\u201d\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid\nit on the table.\n\u201cThere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\u201d he\nsaid.\n",
        "68": "Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it\nto him.\n\u201cAnd Mademoiselle\u2019s address?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\u2019s Wood.\u201d\n",
        "69": "Holmes took a note of it. \u201cOne other question,\u201d said he. \u201cWas the\nphotograph a cabinet?\u201d\n\u201cIt was.\u201d\n\u201cThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have\nsome good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\u201d he added, as the\n",

        "71": "At three o\u2019clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not\nyet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house\nshortly after eight o\u2019clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire,\nhowever, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.\n",
        "72": "I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was\nsurrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were\nassociated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,\nthe nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a\ncharacter of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which\nmade it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable\nmysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very\npossibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\n",
        "73": "It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room.

What a tissue of mysteries and\nimprobabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade\u2019s\nopinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes\u2019 insight that I\ncould not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen\nhis conviction of young McCarthy\u2019s innocence.\n",

I would call your attention very particularly to two points.\n",
        "533": "One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the\npool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was\naway, and he did not know when he would return.

Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any\nwhich presented more singular features than that which was associated\nwith the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.

        "1570": "\u201cI should be very glad now to go upstairs,\u201d said he. \u201cI shall probably\nwish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better\ntake a look at the lower windows before I go up.\u201d\n",
        "1571": "He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the\nlarge one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.

        "1574": "wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a\nlook at it.\u201d He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it\nupon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller\u2019s art,\n",
        "1575": "and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one\nside of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three\ngems had been torn away.\n\u201cNow, Mr. Holder,\u201d said Holmes, \u201chere is the corner which corresponds\n",

An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would\n",
        "1578": "happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a\npistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards\nof your bed and that you heard nothing of it?\u201d\n\u201cI do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.\u201d\n",
        "1579": "\u201cBut perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss\nHolder?\u201d\n\u201cI confess that I still share my uncle\u2019s perplexity.\u201d\n\u201cYour son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\u201d\n\u201cHe had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\u201d\n",

He chucked it\n",

It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for\n",

        "1597": "\u201cDeserted you?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,\nand a note for me lay upon the hall table.

        "1775": "The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be\nincapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If\nyou could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the\nkey upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.\u201d\n\u201cI will do it.\u201d\n",
        "1776": "\u201cExcellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course\nthere is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to\npersonate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.\n",
        "1777": "That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is\nthe daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to\nhave gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in\nheight, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off,\n",
        "1778": "very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of\ncourse, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came\nupon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of\nhers\u2014possibly her _fianc\u00e9_\u2014and no doubt, as you wore the girl\u2019s dress\nand were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he\nsaw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was\nperfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog\n",
        "1779": "is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate\nwith her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case\nis the disposition of the child.\u201d\n\u201cWhat on earth has that to do with it?\u201d I ejaculated.\n",
        "1780": "\u201cMy dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as\nto the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don\u2019t you see\nthat the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first\nreal insight into the character of parents by studying their children.\n",
        "1781": "This child\u2019s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\u2019s\nsake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should\nsuspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in\ntheir power.\u201d\n\u201cI am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\u201d cried our client. \u201cA\nthousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit\nit. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor\n",
        "1782": "creature.\u201d\n\u201cWe must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We\ncan do nothing until seven o\u2019clock. At that hour we shall be with you,\n",
        "1783": "and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.\u201d\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the\nCopper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The\ngroup of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in\nthe light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even\nhad Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\n",
        "1784": "\u201cHave you managed it?\u201d asked Holmes.\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. \u201cThat is Mrs.\nToller in the cellar,\u201d said she. \u201cHer husband lies snoring on the\n",
        "1785": "kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.\nRucastle\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cYou have done well indeed!\u201d cried Holmes with enthusiasm. \u201cNow lead\n",
        "1786": "the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.\u201d\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage,\nand found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had\ndescribed. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he\ntried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came\n",
        "1787": "from within, and at the silence Holmes\u2019 face clouded over.\n\u201cI trust that we are not too late,\u201d said he. \u201cI think, Miss Hunter,\nthat we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to\n",
        "1788": "it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.\u201d\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.\nTogether we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture\n",
        "1789": "save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The\nskylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\n\u201cThere has been some villainy here,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cthis beauty has\nguessed Miss Hunter\u2019s intentions and has carried his victim off.\u201d\n",
        "1790": "\u201cBut how?\u201d\n\u201cThrough the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.\u201d He swung\nhimself up onto the roof. \u201cAh, yes,\u201d he cried, \u201chere\u2019s the end of a\nlong light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.\u201d\n",
        "1791": "\u201cBut it is impossible,\u201d said Miss Hunter; \u201cthe ladder was not there\nwhen the Rucastles went away.\u201d\n\u201cHe has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and\ndangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he\n",
        "1792": "whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be\nas well for you to have your pistol ready.\u201d\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the\ndoor of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his\nhand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of\n",
        "1793": "him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\n\u201cYou villain!\u201d said he, \u201cwhere\u2019s your daughter?\u201d\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\n\u201cIt is for me to ask you that,\u201d he shrieked, \u201cyou thieves! Spies and\nthieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I\u2019ll serve\n",
        "1794": "you!\u201d He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone for the dog!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.\n\u201cI have my revolver,\u201d said I.\n",
        "1795": "\u201cBetter close the front door,\u201d cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the\nstairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the\nbaying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying\nsound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red\nface and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\n",
        "1796": "\u201cMy God!\u201d he cried. \u201cSomeone has loosed the dog. It\u2019s not been fed for\ntwo days. Quick, quick, or it\u2019ll be too late!\u201d\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller\nhurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle\n",
        "1797": "buried in Rucastle\u2019s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the\nground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its\nkeen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With\nmuch labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly\nmangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and\n",
        "1798": "having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I\ndid what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him\nwhen the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\n\u201cMrs. Toller!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.\n",
        "1799": "\u201cYes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up\nto you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn\u2019t let me know what you were\nplanning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.\u201d\n",
        "1800": "\u201cHa!\u201d said Holmes, looking keenly at her. \u201cIt is clear that Mrs. Toller\nknows more about this matter than anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\u201d\n",
        "1801": "\u201cThen, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points\non which I must confess that I am still in the dark.\u201d\n\u201cI will soon make it clear to you,\u201d said she; \u201cand I\u2019d have done so\nbefore now if I could ha\u2019 got out from the cellar. If there\u2019s\npolice-court business over this, you\u2019ll remember that I was the one\nthat stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice\u2019s friend too.\n",
        "1802": "\u201cShe was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\u2019t, from the time that her\nfather married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything,\nbut it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr. Fowler\nat a friend\u2019s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of\n",
        "1803": "her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she\nnever said a word about them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle\u2019s\nhands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a\nhusband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give\nhim, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her\n",
        "1804": "to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her\nmoney. When she wouldn\u2019t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got\nbrain-fever, and for six weeks was at death\u2019s door. Then she got better\nat last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but\nthat didn\u2019t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as\ntrue as man could be.\u201d\n",
        "1805": "\u201cAh,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI think that what you have been good enough to tell\nus makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that\nremains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\nimprisonment?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAnd brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\ndisagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.\u201d\n",
        "1806": "\u201cThat was it, sir.\u201d\n\u201cBut Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\nblockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\nmetallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the\nsame as his.\u201d\n",
        "1807": "\u201cMr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,\u201d said Mrs.\nToller serenely.\n\u201cAnd in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of\ndrink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master\nhad gone out.\u201d\n",
        "1808": "\u201cYou have it, sir, just as it happened.\u201d\n\u201cI am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cfor you\nhave certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes\n",
