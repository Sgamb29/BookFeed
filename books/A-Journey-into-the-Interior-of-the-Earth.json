Jules Verne deserve to be made\nwidely known in English-speaking countries by means of carefully\nprepared translations. Witty and ingenious adaptations of the\nresearches and discoveries of modern science to the popular taste,\nwhich demands that these should be presented to ordinary readers in\nthe lighter form of cleverly mingled truth and fiction, these books\nwill assuredly be read with profit and delight, especially by English\nyouth.

For a long time to come the natives of that\ninteresting island, who cleave to their desert home with all that\n_amor patriae_ which is so much more easily understood than\nexplained, will look, and look not in vain, for the help of those on\nwhom fall the smiles of a kindlier sun in regions not torn by\nearthquakes nor blasted and ravaged by volcanic fires.

        "11": "\"M. Liedenbrock so soon!\" cried poor Martha in great alarm, half\nopening the dining-room door.\n\"Yes, Martha; but very likely the dinner is not half cooked, for it\nis not two yet. Saint Michael's clock has only just struck half-past\n",
        "12": "one.\"\n\"Then why has the master come home so soon?\"\n\"Perhaps he will tell us that himself.\"\n",
        "13": "\"Here he is, Monsieur Axel; I will run and hide myself while you\nargue with him.\"\nAnd Martha retreated in safety into her own dominions.\nI was left alone. But how was it possible for a man of my undecided\n",
        "14": "turn of mind to argue successfully with so irascible a person as the\nProfessor? With this persuasion I was hurrying away to my own little\nretreat upstairs, when the street door creaked upon its hinges; heavy\nfeet made the whole flight of stairs to shake; and the master of the\nhouse, passing rapidly through the dining-room, threw himself in\nhaste into his own sanctum.\nBut on his rapid way he had found time to fling his hazel stick into\na corner, his rough broadbrim upon the table, and these few emphatic\nwords at his nephew:\n\"Axel, follow me!\"\n",
        "15": "I had scarcely had time to move when the Professor was again shouting\nafter me:\n\"What! not come yet?\"\nAnd I rushed into my redoubtable master's study.\nOtto Liedenbrock had no mischief in him, I willingly allow that; but\nunless he very considerably changes as he grows older, at the end he\nwill be a most original character.\n",
        "16": "He was professor at the Johann\u00e6um, and was delivering a series of\nlectures on mineralogy, in the course of every one of which he broke\ninto a passion once or twice at least. Not at all that he was\nover-anxious about the improvement of his class, or about the degree\nof attention with which they listened to him, or the success which\nmight eventually crown his labours. Such little matters of detail\nnever troubled him much. His teaching was as the German philosophy\n",

        "18": "was a learned miser.\nGermany has not a few professors of this sort.\nTo his misfortune, my uncle was not gifted with a sufficiently rapid\nutterance; not, to be sure, when he was talking at home, but\ncertainly in his public delivery; this is a want much to be deplored\nin a speaker. The fact is, that during the course of his lectures at\n",
        "19": "the Johann\u00e6um, the Professor often came to a complete standstill; he\nfought with wilful words that refused to pass his struggling lips,\nsuch words as resist and distend the cheeks, and at last break out\ninto the unasked-for shape of a round and most unscientific oath:\nthen his fury would gradually abate.\nNow in mineralogy there are many half-Greek and half-Latin terms,\nvery hard to articulate, and which would be most trying to a poet's\nmeasures. I don't wish to say a word against so respectable a\nscience, far be that from me. True, in the august presence of\n",
        "20": "rhombohedral crystals, retinasphaltic resins, gehlenites, Fassaites,\nmolybdenites, tungstates of manganese, and titanite of zirconium,\nwhy, the most facile of tongues may make a slip now and then.\nIt therefore happened that this venial fault of my uncle's came to be\npretty well understood in time, and an unfair advantage was taken of\nit; the students laid wait for him in dangerous places, and when he\nbegan to stumble, loud was the laughter, which is not in good taste,\nnot even in Germans. And if there was always a full audience to\nhonour the Liedenbrock courses, I should be sorry to conjecture how\nmany came to make merry at my uncle's expense.\n",
        "21": "Nevertheless my good uncle was a man of deep learning--a fact I am\nmost anxious to assert and reassert. Sometimes he might irretrievably\ninjure a specimen by his too great ardour in handling it; but still\nhe united the genius of a true geologist with the keen eye of the\nmineralogist. Armed with his hammer, his steel pointer, his magnetic\nneedles, his blowpipe, and his bottle of nitric acid, he was a\npowerful man of science. He would refer any mineral to its proper\n",
        "22": "place among the six hundred [1] elementary substances now enumerated,\nby its fracture, its appearance, its hardness, its fusibility, its\nsonorousness, its smell, and its taste.\nThe name of Liedenbrock was honourably mentioned in colleges and\nlearned societies. Humphry Davy, [2] Humboldt, Captain Sir John\nFranklin, General Sabine, never failed to call upon him on their way\nthrough Hamburg. Becquerel, Ebelman, Brewster, Dumas, Milne-Edwards,\n",
        "23": "Saint-Claire-Deville frequently consulted him upon the most difficult\nproblems in chemistry, a science which was indebted to him for\nconsiderable discoveries, for in 1853 there had appeared at Leipzig\nan imposing folio by Otto Liedenbrock, entitled, \"A Treatise upon\nTranscendental Chemistry,\" with plates; a work, however, which failed\nto cover its expenses.\nTo all these titles to honour let me add that my uncle was the\ncurator of the museum of mineralogy formed by M. Struve, the Russian\nambassador; a most valuable collection, the fame of which is European.\n",
        "24": "Such was the gentleman who addressed me in that impetuous manner.\nFancy a tall, spare man, of an iron constitution, and with a fair\ncomplexion which took off a good ten years from the fifty he must own\nto. His restless eyes were in incessant motion behind his full-sized\nspectacles. His long, thin nose was like a knife blade. Boys have\n",
        "25": "been heard to remark that that organ was magnetised and attracted\niron filings. But this was merely a mischievous report; it had no\nattraction except for snuff, which it seemed to draw to itself in\ngreat quantities.\nWhen I have added, to complete my portrait, that my uncle walked by\nmathematical strides of a yard and a half, and that in walking he\nkept his fists firmly closed, a sure sign of an irritable\ntemperament, I think I shall have said enough to disenchant any one\nwho should by mistake have coveted much of his company.\n",
        "26": "He lived in his own little house in K\u00f6nigstrasse, a structure half\nbrick and half wood, with a gable cut into steps; it looked upon one\nof those winding canals which intersect each other in the middle of\nthe ancient quarter of Hamburg, and which the great fire of 1842 had\nfortunately spared.\n[1] Sixty-three. (Tr.)\n[2] As Sir Humphry Davy died in 1829, the translator must be pardoned\nfor pointing out here an anachronism, unless we are to assume that\nthe learned Professor's celebrity dawned in his earliest years. (Tr.)\n",
        "27": "It is true that the old house stood slightly off the perpendicular,\nand bulged out a little towards the street; its roof sloped a little\nto one side, like the cap over the left ear of a Tugendbund student;\nits lines wanted accuracy; but after all, it stood firm, thanks to an\nold elm which buttressed it in front, and which often in spring sent\nits young sprays through the window panes.\nMy uncle was tolerably well off for a German professor. The house was\nhis own, and everything in it. The living contents were his\n",
        "28": "god-daughter Gr\u00e4uben, a young Virlandaise of seventeen, Martha, and\nmyself. As his nephew and an orphan, I became his laboratory\nassistant.\nI freely confess that I was exceedingly fond of geology and all its\nkindred sciences; the blood of a mineralogist was in my veins, and in\nthe midst of my specimens I was always happy.\n",
        "29": "In a word, a man might live happily enough in the little old house in\nthe K\u00f6nigstrasse, in spite of the restless impatience of its master,\nfor although he was a little too excitable--he was very fond of me.\nBut the man had no notion how to wait; nature herself was too slow\nfor him. In April, after he had planted in the terra-cotta pots\noutside his window seedling plants of mignonette and convolvulus, he\nwould go and give them a little pull by their leaves to make them\ngrow faster. In dealing with such a strange individual there was\n",
        "30": "nothing for it but prompt obedience. I therefore rushed after him.\nCHAPTER II.\nA MYSTERY TO BE SOLVED AT ANY PRICE\nThat study of his was a museum, and nothing else. Specimens of\n",
        "31": "everything known in mineralogy lay there in their places in perfect\norder, and correctly named, divided into inflammable, metallic, and\nlithoid minerals.\nHow well I knew all these bits of science! Many a time, instead of\nenjoying the company of lads of my own age, I had preferred dusting\nthese graphites, anthracites, coals, lignites, and peats! And there\n",
        "32": "were bitumens, resins, organic salts, to be protected from the least\ngrain of dust; and metals, from iron to gold, metals whose current\nvalue altogether disappeared in the presence of the republican\nequality of scientific specimens; and stones too, enough to rebuild\nentirely the house in K\u00f6nigstrasse, even with a handsome additional\nroom, which would have suited me admirably.\nBut on entering this study now I thought of none of all these\nwonders; my uncle alone filled my thoughts. He had thrown himself\ninto a velvet easy-chair, and was grasping between his hands a book\nover which he bent, pondering with intense admiration.\n",
        "33": "\"Here's a remarkable book! What a wonderful book!\" he was exclaiming.\nThese ejaculations brought to my mind the fact that my uncle was\nliable to occasional fits of bibliomania; but no old book had any\nvalue in his eyes unless it had the virtue of being nowhere else to\nbe found, or, at any rate, of being illegible.\n\"Well, now; don't you see it yet? Why I have got a priceless\n",
        "34": "treasure, that I found his morning, in rummaging in old Hevelius's\nshop, the Jew.\"\n\"Magnificent!\" I replied, with a good imitation of enthusiasm.\nWhat was the good of all this fuss about an old quarto, bound in\nrough calf, a yellow, faded volume, with a ragged seal depending from\nit?\n",
        "35": "But for all that there was no lull yet in the admiring exclamations\nof the Professor.\n\"See,\" he went on, both asking the questions and supplying the\nanswers. \"Isn't it a beauty? Yes; splendid! Did you ever see such a\nbinding? Doesn't the book open easily? Yes; it stops open anywhere.\n",
        "36": "But does it shut equally well? Yes; for the binding and the leaves\nare flush, all in a straight line, and no gaps or openings anywhere.\nAnd look at its back, after seven hundred years. Why, Bozerian,\n",
        "37": "Closs, or Purgold might have been proud of such a binding!\"\nWhile rapidly making these comments my uncle kept opening and\nshutting the old tome. I really could do no less than ask a question\nabout its contents, although I did not feel the slightest interest.\n",
        "38": "\"And what is the title of this marvellous work?\" I asked with an\naffected eagerness which he must have been very blind not to see\nthrough.\n\"This work,\" replied my uncle, firing up with renewed enthusiasm,\n\"this work is the Heims Kringla of Snorre Turlleson, the most famous\nIcelandic author of the twelfth century! It is the chronicle of the\n",
        "39": "Norwegian princes who ruled in Iceland.\"\n\"Indeed;\" I cried, keeping up wonderfully, \"of course it is a German\ntranslation?\"\n\"What!\" sharply replied the Professor, \"a translation! What should I\n",
        "40": "do with a translation? This _is_ the Icelandic original, in the\nmagnificent idiomatic vernacular, which is both rich and simple, and\nadmits of an infinite variety of grammatical combinations and verbal\nmodifications.\"\n\"Like German.\" I happily ventured.\n",
        "41": "\"Yes,\" replied my uncle, shrugging his shoulders; \"but, in addition\nto all this, the Icelandic has three numbers like the Greek, and\nirregular declensions of nouns proper like the Latin.\"\n\"Ah!\" said I, a little moved out of my indifference; \"and is the type\ngood?\"\n",
        "42": "\"Type! What do you mean by talking of type, wretched Axel? Type! Do\nyou take it for a printed book, you ignorant fool? It is a\nmanuscript, a Runic manuscript.\"\n",
        "43": "\"Runic?\"\n\"Yes. Do you want me to explain what that is?\"\n\"Of course not,\" I replied in the tone of an injured man. But my\n",
        "44": "uncle persevered, and told me, against my will, of many things I\ncared nothing about.\n\"Runic characters were in use in Iceland in former ages. They were\ninvented, it is said, by Odin himself. Look there, and wonder,\n",
        "45": "impious young man, and admire these letters, the invention of the\nScandinavian god!\"\nWell, well! not knowing what to say, I was going to prostrate myself\nbefore this wonderful book, a way of answering equally pleasing to\ngods and kings, and which has the advantage of never giving them any\nembarrassment, when a little incident happened to divert conversation\ninto another channel.\n",
        "46": "This was the appearance of a dirty slip of parchment, which slipped\nout of the volume and fell upon the floor.\nMy uncle pounced upon this shred with incredible avidity. An old\ndocument, enclosed an immemorial time within the folds of this old\nbook, had for him an immeasurable value.\n",
        "47": "\"What's this?\" he cried.\nAnd he laid out upon the table a piece of parchment, five inches by\nthree, and along which were traced certain mysterious characters.\nHere is the exact facsimile. I think it important to let these\n",

But, what on earth is their meaning?\"\nRunic letters appearing to my mind to be an invention of the learned\nto mystify this poor world, I was not sorry to see my uncle suffering\nthe pangs of mystification.

        "49": "from his fingers, which were beginning to work with terrible energy.\n\"It is certainly old Icelandic,\" he muttered between his teeth.\nAnd Professor Liedenbrock must have known, for he was acknowledged to\nbe quite a polyglot. Not that he could speak fluently in the two\n",

        "51": "I am afraid he sent that soup to where it would boil away to nothing,\nand Martha took to her heels for safety. I followed her, and hardly\nknowing how I got there I found myself seated in my usual place.\nI waited a few minutes. No Professor came. Never within my\n",

There was parsley soup, an omelette of ham\ngarnished with spiced sorrel, a fillet of veal with compote of\nprunes; for dessert, crystallised fruit; the whole washed down with\nsweet Moselle.\n",
        "53": "All this my uncle was going to sacrifice to a bit of old parchment.\nAs an affectionate and attentive nephew I considered it my duty to\neat for him as well as for myself, which I did conscientiously.\n\"I have never known such a thing,\" said Martha. \"M. Liedenbrock is\n",

        "55": "My opinion was, that nothing more serious would happen than an awful\nscene when my uncle should have discovered that his dinner was\ndevoured. I had come to the last of the fruit when a very loud voice\ntore me away from the pleasures of my dessert. With one spring I\nbounded out of the dining-room into the study.\n",

Therefore there are two hundred years\nbetween the manuscript and the document.\"\n",
        "64": "I admitted that this was a strictly logical conclusion.\n\"I am therefore led to imagine,\" continued my uncle, \"that some\npossessor of this book wrote these mysterious letters. But who was\nthat possessor? Is his name nowhere to be found in the manuscript?\"\n",
        "65": "My uncle raised his spectacles, took up a strong lens, and carefully\nexamined the blank pages of the book. On the front of the second, the\ntitle-page, he noticed a sort of stain which looked like an ink blot.\nBut in looking at it very closely he thought he could distinguish\nsome half-effaced letters. My uncle at once fastened upon this as the\n",
        "66": "centre of interest, and he laboured at that blot, until by the help\nof his microscope he ended by making out the following Runic\ncharacters which he read without difficulty.\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" he cried in triumph. \"Why that is the name of\nanother Icelander, a savant of the sixteenth century, a celebrated\nalchemist!\"\n",
        "67": "I gazed at my uncle with satisfactory admiration.\n\"Those alchemists,\" he resumed, \"Avicenna, Bacon, Lully, Paracelsus,\nwere the real and only savants of their time. They made discoveries\nat which we are astonished. Has not this Saknussemm concealed under\n",
        "68": "his cryptogram some surprising invention? It is so; it must be so!\"\nThe Professor's imagination took fire at this hypothesis.\n\"No doubt,\" I ventured to reply, \"but what interest would he have in\nthus hiding so marvellous a discovery?\"\n",

        "165": "Augustus Petermann, at Liepzig. Nothing could be more apropos. Take\ndown the third atlas in the second shelf in the large bookcase,\nseries Z, plate 4.\"\nI rose, and with the help of such precise instructions could not fail\nto find the required atlas. My uncle opened it and said:\n",
        "166": "\"Here is one of the best maps of Iceland, that of Handersen, and I\nbelieve this will solve the worst of our difficulties.\"\nI bent over the map.\n\"You see this volcanic island,\" said the Professor; \"observe that all\nthe volcanoes are called jokuls, a word which means glacier in\nIcelandic, and under the high latitude of Iceland nearly all the\nactive volcanoes discharge through beds of ice. Hence this term of\n",
        "167": "jokul is applied to all the eruptive mountains in Iceland.\"\n\"Very good,\" said I; \"but what of Sneffels?\"\nI was hoping that this question would be unanswerable; but I was\nmistaken. My uncle replied:\n",
        "168": "\"Follow my finger along the west coast of Iceland. Do you see\nRejkiavik, the capital? You do. Well; ascend the innumerable fiords\nthat indent those sea-beaten shores, and stop at the sixty-fifth\ndegree of latitude. What do you see there?\"\n",
        "169": "\"I see a peninsula looking like a thigh bone with the knee bone at\nthe end of it.\"\n\"A very fair comparison, my lad. Now do you see anything upon that\nknee bone?\"\n",
        "170": "\"Yes; a mountain rising out of the sea.\"\n\"Right. That is Sn\u00e6fell.\"\n\"That Sn\u00e6fell?\"\n",
        "171": "\"It is. It is a mountain five thousand feet high, one of the most\nremarkable in the world, if its crater leads down to the centre of\nthe earth.\"\n\"But that is impossible,\" I said shrugging my shoulders, and\ndisgusted at such a ridiculous supposition.\n",
        "172": "\"Impossible?\" said the Professor severely; \"and why, pray?\"\n\"Because this crater is evidently filled with lava and burning rocks,\nand therefore--\"\n\"But suppose it is an extinct volcano?\"\n\"Extinct?\"\n",
        "173": "\"Yes; the number of active volcanoes on the surface of the globe is\nat the present time only about three hundred. But there is a very\nmuch larger number of extinct ones. Now, Sn\u00e6fell is one of these.\nSince historic times there has been but one eruption of this\nmountain, that of 1219; from that time it has quieted down more and\nmore, and now it is no longer reckoned among active volcanoes.\"\n",
        "174": "To such positive statements I could make no reply. I therefore took\nrefuge in other dark passages of the document.\n\"What is the meaning of this word Scartaris, and what have the\nkalends of July to do with it?\"\n",

        "177": "did the Icelandic sage do? He observed that at the approach of the\nkalends of July, that is to say in the last days of June, one of the\npeaks, called Scartaris, flung its shadow down the mouth of that\nparticular crater, and he committed that fact to his document. Could\nthere possibly have been a more exact guide? As soon as we have\n",
        "178": "arrived at the summit of Sn\u00e6fell we shall have no hesitation as to\nthe proper road to take.\"\nDecidedly, my uncle had answered every one of my objections. I saw\nthat his position on the old parchment was impregnable. I therefore\n",
        "179": "ceased to press him upon that part of the subject, and as above all\nthings he must be convinced, I passed on to scientific objections,\nwhich in my opinion were far more serious.\n\"Well, then,\" I said, \"I am forced to admit that Saknussemm's\nsentence is clear, and leaves no room for doubt.

        "181": "\"The theories say that, do they?\" replied the Professor in the tone\nof a meek disciple. \"Oh! unpleasant theories! How the theories will\nhinder us, won't they?\"\n",
        "182": "I saw that he was only laughing at me; but I went on all the same.\n\"Yes; it is perfectly well known that the internal temperature rises\none degree for every 70 feet in depth; now, admitting this proportion\nto be constant, and the radius of the earth being fifteen hundred\nleagues, there must be a temperature of 360,032 degrees at the centre\nof the earth. Therefore, all the substances that compose the body of\nthis earth must exist there in a state of incandescent gas; for the\nmetals that most resist the action of heat, gold, and platinum, and\nthe hardest rocks, can never be either solid or liquid under such a\ntemperature. I have therefore good reason for asking if it is\n",
        "183": "possible to penetrate through such a medium.\"\n\"So, Axel, it is the heat that troubles you?\"\n\"Of course it is. Were we to reach a depth of thirty miles we should\n",
        "184": "have arrived at the limit of the terrestrial crust, for there the\ntemperature will be more than 2372 degrees.\"\n\"Are you afraid of being put into a state of fusion?\"\n\"I will leave you to decide that question,\" I answered rather\nsullenly. \"This is my decision,\" replied Professor Liedenbrock,\n",
        "185": "putting on one of his grandest airs. \"Neither you nor anybody else\nknows with any certainty what is going on in the interior of this\nglobe, since not the twelve thousandth part of its radius is known;\nscience is eminently perfectible; and every new theory is soon routed\nby a newer. Was it not always believed until Fourier that the\ntemperature of the interplanetary spaces decreased perpetually? and\n",
        "186": "is it not known at the present time that the greatest cold of the\nethereal regions is never lower than 40 degrees below zero Fahr.? Why\nshould it not be the same with the internal heat? Why should it not,\nat a certain depth, attain an impassable limit, instead of rising to\nsuch a point as to fuse the most infusible metals?\"\n",
        "187": "As my uncle was now taking his stand upon hypotheses, of course,\nthere was nothing to be said.\n\"Well, I will tell you that true savants, amongst them Poisson, have\ndemonstrated that if a heat of 360,000 degrees [1] existed in the\ninterior of the globe, the fiery gases arising from the fused matter\nwould acquire an elastic force which the crust of the earth would be\nunable to resist, and that it would explode like the plates of a\nbursting boiler.\"\n\"That is Poisson's opinion, my uncle, nothing more.\"\n",
        "188": "\"Granted. But it is likewise the creed adopted by other distinguished\ngeologists, that the interior of the globe is neither gas nor water,\nnor any of the heaviest minerals known, for in none of these cases\nwould the earth weigh what it does.\"\n\"Oh, with figures you may prove anything!\"\n",
        "189": "\"But is it the same with facts! Is it not known that the number of\nvolcanoes has diminished since the first days of creation? and if\nthere is central heat may we not thence conclude that it is in\nprocess of diminution?\"\n",
        "190": "\"My good uncle, if you will enter into the legion of speculation, I\ncan discuss the matter no longer.\"\n\"But I have to tell you that the highest names have come to the\nsupport of my views. Do you remember a visit paid to me by the\ncelebrated chemist, Humphry Davy, in 1825?\"\n",
        "191": "\"Not at all, for I was not born until nineteen years afterwards.\"\n\"Well, Humphry Davy did call upon me on his way through Hamburg. We\nwere long engaged in discussing, amongst other problems, the\nhypothesis of the liquid structure of the terrestrial nucleus. We\n",
        "192": "were agreed that it could not be in a liquid state, for a reason\nwhich science has never been able to confute.\"\n[1] The degrees of temperature are given by Jules Verne according to\nthe centigrade system, for which we will in each case substitute the\nFahrenheit measurement. (Tr.)\n\"What is that reason?\" I said, rather astonished.\n",
        "193": "\"Because this liquid mass would be subject, like the ocean, to the\nlunar attraction, and therefore twice every day there would be\ninternal tides, which, upheaving the terrestrial crust, would cause\nperiodical earthquakes!\"\n\"Yet it is evident that the surface of the globe has been subject to\nthe action of fire,\" I replied, \"and it is quite reasonable to\nsuppose that the external crust cooled down first, whilst the heat\ntook refuge down to the centre.\"\n\"Quite a mistake,\" my uncle answered. \"The earth has been heated by\n",
        "194": "combustion on its surface, that is all. Its surface was composed of a\ngreat number of metals, such as potassium and sodium, which have the\npeculiar property of igniting at the mere contact with air and water;\nthese metals kindled when the atmospheric vapours fell in rain upon\nthe soil; and by and by, when the waters penetrated into the fissures\nof the crust of the earth, they broke out into fresh combustion with\nexplosions and eruptions. Such was the cause of the numerous\nvolcanoes at the origin of the earth.\"\n",
        "195": "\"Upon my word, this is a very clever hypothesis,\" I exclaimed, in\nspite rather of myself.\n\"And which Humphry Davy demonstrated to me by a simple experiment. He\nformed a small ball of the metals which I have named, and which was a\nvery fair representation of our globe; whenever he caused a fine dew\nof rain to fall upon its surface, it heaved up into little\nmonticules, it became oxydized and formed miniature mountains; a\ncrater broke open at one of its summits; the eruption took place, and\ncommunicated to the whole of the ball such a heat that it could not\nbe held in the hand.\"\n",
        "196": "In truth, I was beginning to be shaken by the Professor's arguments,\nbesides which he gave additional weight to them by his usual ardour\nand fervent enthusiasm.\n\"You see, Axel,\" he added, \"the condition of the terrestrial nucleus\nhas given rise to various hypotheses among geologists; there is no\nproof at all for this internal heat; my opinion is that there is no\nsuch thing, it cannot be; besides we shall see for ourselves, and,\nlike Arne Saknussemm, we shall know exactly what to hold as truth\nconcerning this grand question.\"\n\"Very well, we shall see,\" I replied, feeling myself carried off by\nhis contagious enthusiasm. \"Yes, we shall see; that is, if it is\n",
        "197": "possible to see anything there.\"\n\"And why not? May we not depend upon electric phenomena to give us\nlight? May we not even expect light from the atmosphere, the pressure\n",

        "337": "\"Have you some private document in your possession?\" asked our host.\n\"No; I was only supposing a case.\"\n\"Oh, very well,\" answered M. Fridrikssen, who was kind enough not to\n",
        "338": "pursue the subject when he had noticed the embarrassment of his\nfriend. \"I hope you will not leave our island until you have seen\nsome of its mineralogical wealth.\"\n\"Certainly,\" replied my uncle; \"but I am rather late; or have not\nothers been here before me?\"\n",
        "339": "\"Yes, Herr Liedenbrock; the labours of MM. Olafsen and Povelsen,\npursued by order of the king, the researches of Tro\u00efl the scientific\nmission of MM. Gaimard and Robert on the French corvette _La\nRecherche,_ [1] and lately the observations of scientific men who\ncame in the _Reine Hortense,_ have added materially to our knowledge\nof Iceland. But I assure you there is plenty left.\"\n",
        "340": "\"Do you think so?\" said my uncle, pretending to look very modest, and\ntrying to hide the curiosity was flashing out of his eyes.\n\"Oh, yes; how many mountains, glaciers, and volcanoes there are to\nstudy, which are as yet but imperfectly known! Then, without going\n",
        "341": "any further, that mountain in the horizon. That is Sn\u00e6fell.\"\n\"Ah!\" said my uncle, as coolly as he was able, \"is that Sn\u00e6fell?\"\n\"Yes; one of the most curious volcanoes, and the crater of which has\nscarcely ever been visited.\"\n",
        "342": "\"Is it extinct?\"\n\"Oh, yes; more than five hundred years.\"\n\"Well,\" replied my uncle, who was frantically locking his legs together\nto keep himself from jumping up in the air, \"that is where I mean to\nbegin my geological studies, there on that Seffel--Fessel--what do you\ncall it?\"\n",
        "343": "\"Sn\u00e6fell,\" replied the excellent M. Fridrikssen.\nThis part of the conversation was in Latin; I had understood every\nword of it, and I could hardly conceal my amusement at seeing my\nuncle trying to keep down the excitement and satisfaction which were\nbrimming over in every limb and every feature. He tried hard to put\non an innocent little expression of simplicity; but it looked like a\ndiabolical grin.\n",
        "344": "[1] _Recherche_ was sent out in 1835 by Admiral Duperr\u00e9 to learn the\nfate of the lost expedition of M. de Blosseville in the _Lilloise_\nwhich has never been heard of.\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"your words decide me. We will try to scale that\n",

        "346": "\"Oh, no, no!\" replied my uncle with great animation, \"we would not\ndisturb any one for the world, M. Fridrikssen. Still, I thank you\nwith all my heart: the company of such a talented man would have been\nvery serviceable, but the duties of your profession--\"\nI am glad to think that our host, in the innocence of his Icelandic\nsoul, was blind to the transparent artifices of my uncle.\n",
        "347": "\"I very much approve of your beginning with that volcano, M.\nLiedenbrock. You will gather a harvest of interesting observations.\nBut, tell me, how do you expect to get to the peninsula of Sn\u00e6fell?\"\n",
        "348": "\"By sea, crossing the bay. That's the most direct way.\"\n\"No doubt; but it is impossible.\"\n\"Why?\"\n",
        "349": "\"Because we don't possess a single boat at Rejkiavik.\"\n\"You don't mean to say so?\"\n\"You will have to go by land, following the shore. It will be longer,\n",
        "350": "but more interesting.\"\n\"Very well, then; and now I shall have to see about a guide.\"\n\"I have one to offer you.\"\n",
        "351": "\"A safe, intelligent man.\"\n\"Yes; an inhabitant of that peninsula. He is an eider-down hunter, and\nvery clever. He speaks Danish perfectly.\"\n",
        "352": "\"When can I see him?\"\n\"To-morrow, if you like.\"\n\"Why not to-day?\"\n",
        "353": "\"Because he won't be here till to-morrow.\"\n\"To-morrow, then,\" added my uncle with a sigh.\nThis momentous conversation ended in a few minutes with warm\nacknowledgments paid by the German to the Icelandic Professor. At\n",

        "355": "When I awoke I heard my uncle talking at a great rate in the next\nroom. I immediately dressed and joined him.\nHe was conversing in the Danish language with a tall man, of robust\nbuild. This fine fellow must have been possessed of great strength.\nHis eyes, set in a large and ingenuous face, seemed to me very\nintelligent; they were of a dreamy sea-blue. Long hair, which would\n",
        "356": "have been called red even in England, fell in long meshes upon his\nbroad shoulders. The movements of this native were lithe and supple;\nbut he made little use of his arms in speaking, like a man who knew\nnothing or cared nothing about the language of gestures. His whole\nappearance bespoke perfect calmness and self-possession, not\nindolence but tranquillity. It was felt at once that he would be\n",
        "357": "beholden to nobody, that he worked for his own convenience, and that\nnothing in this world could astonish or disturb his philosophic\ncalmness.\nI caught the shades of this Icelander's character by the way in which\nhe listened to the impassioned flow of words which fell from the\nProfessor. He stood with arms crossed, perfectly unmoved by my\nuncle's incessant gesticulations. A negative was expressed by a slow\n",
        "358": "movement of the head from left to right, an affirmative by a slight\nbend, so slight that his long hair scarcely moved. He carried economy\nof motion even to parsimony.\nCertainly I should never have dreamt in looking at this man that he\nwas a hunter; he did not look likely to frighten his game, nor did he\nseem as if he would even get near it. But the mystery was explained\n",
        "359": "when M. Fridrikssen informed me that this tranquil personage was only\na hunter of the eider duck, whose under plumage constitutes the chief\nwealth of the island. This is the celebrated eider down, and it\nrequires no great rapidity of movement to get it.\n",
        "360": "Early in summer the female, a very pretty bird, goes to build her\nnest among the rocks of the fiords with which the coast is fringed.\nAfter building the nest she feathers it with down plucked from her\nown breast. Immediately the hunter, or rather the trader, comes and\nrobs the nest, and the female recommences her work. This goes on as\n",
        "361": "long as she has any down left. When she has stripped herself bare the\nmale takes his turn to pluck himself. But as the coarse and hard\nplumage of the male has no commercial value, the hunter does not take\nthe trouble to rob the nest of this; the female therefore lays her\neggs in the spoils of her mate, the young are hatched, and next year\nthe harvest begins again.\n",
        "362": "Now, as the eider duck does not select steep cliffs for her nest, but\nrather the smooth terraced rocks which slope to the sea, the\nIcelandic hunter might exercise his calling without any inconvenient\nexertion. He was a farmer who was not obliged either to sow or reap\nhis harvest, but merely to gather it in.\nThis grave, phlegmatic, and silent individual was called Hans Bjelke;\nand he came recommended by M. Fridrikssen. He was our future guide.\n",
        "363": "His manners were a singular contrast with my uncle's.\nNevertheless, they soon came to understand each other. Neither looked\nat the amount of the payment: the one was ready to accept whatever\nwas offered; the other was ready to give whatever was demanded. Never\n",
        "364": "was bargain more readily concluded.\nThe result of the treaty was, that Hans engaged on his part to\nconduct us to the village of Stapi, on the south shore of the Sn\u00e6fell\npeninsula, at the very foot of the volcano. By land this would be\nabout twenty-two miles, to be done, said my uncle, in two days.\n",
        "365": "But when he learnt that the Danish mile was 24,000 feet long, he was\nobliged to modify his calculations and allow seven or eight days for\nthe march.\nFour horses were to be placed at our disposal--two to carry him and\nme, two for the baggage. Hams, as was his custom, would go on foot.\nHe knew all that part of the coast perfectly, and promised to take us\nthe shortest way.\n",
        "366": "His engagement was not to terminate with our arrival at Stapi; he was\nto continue in my uncle's service for the whole period of his\nscientific researches, for the remuneration of three rixdales a week\n(about twelve shillings), but it was an express article of the\ncovenant that his wages should be counted out to him every Saturday\nat six o'clock in the evening, which, according to him, was one\nindispensable part of the engagement.\nThe start was fixed for the 16th of June. My uncle wanted to pay the\nhunter a portion in advance, but he refused with one word:\n\"_Efter,_\" said he.\n",
        "367": "\"After,\" said the Professor for my edification.\nThe treaty concluded, Hans silently withdrew.\n\"A famous fellow,\" cried my uncle; \"but he little thinks of the\nmarvellous part he has to play in the future.\"\n",
        "368": "\"So he is to go with us as far as--\"\n\"As far as the centre of the earth, Axel.\"\nForty-eight hours were left before our departure; to my great regret\nI had to employ them in preparations; for all our ingenuity was\nrequired to pack every article to the best advantage; instruments\nhere, arms there, tools in this package, provisions in that: four\nsets of packages in all.\nThe instruments were:\n1. An Eigel's centigrade thermometer, graduated up to 150 degrees\n",
        "369": "(302 degrees Fahr.), which seemed to me too much or too little.

An aneroid barometer, to indicate extreme pressures of the\n",
        "370": "atmosphere. An ordinary barometer would not have answered the\npurpose, as the pressure would increase during our descent to a point\nwhich the mercurial barometer [1] would not register.\n3. A chronometer, made by Boissonnas, jun., of Geneva, accurately set\n",

        "372": "6. Two of Ruhmkorff's apparatus, which, by means of an electric\ncurrent, supplied a safe and handy portable light [2]\nThe arms consisted of two of Purdy's rifles and two brace of pistols.\nBut what did we want arms for? We had neither savages nor wild beasts\n",
        "373": "to fear, I supposed.

In\nfact, the great plutonic action is confined to the central portion of\nthe island; there, rocks of the trappean and volcanic class,\nincluding trachyte, basalt, and tuffs and agglomerates associated\nwith streams of lava, have made this a land of supernatural horrors.\n",

The building was\nconstructed of roughly squared timbers, with rooms on both sides,\nfour in number, all opening out into the one passage: these were the\nkitchen, the weaving shop, the badstofa, or family sleeping-room, and\nthe visitors' room, which was the best of all. My uncle, whose height\nhad not been thought of in building the house, of course hit his head\nseveral times against the beams that projected from the ceilings.\n",

I\nwas hardly expecting so much comfort; the only discomfort proceeded\nfrom the strong odour of dried fish, hung meat, and sour milk, of\nwhich my nose made bitter complaints.\n",
        "423": "When we had laid aside our travelling wraps the voice of the host was\nheard inviting us to the kitchen, the only room where a fire was\nlighted even in the severest cold.\nMy uncle lost no time in obeying the friendly call, nor was I slack\nin following.\nThe kitchen chimney was constructed on the ancient pattern; in the\nmiddle of the room was a stone for a hearth, over it in the roof a\nhole to let the smoke escape. The kitchen was also a dining-room.\n",

At\nthat moment our hunter returned, who had been seeing his horses\nprovided for; that is to say, he had economically let them loose in\nthe fields, where the poor beasts had to content themselves with the\nscanty moss they could pull off the rocks and a few meagre sea weeds,\nand the next day they would not fail to come of themselves and resume\nthe labours of the previous day.\n\"_S\u00e6llvertu,_\" said Hans.\n",

        "444": "Basalt is a brownish rock of igneous origin. It assumes regular\nforms, the arrangement of which is often very surprising. Here nature\nhad done her work geometrically, with square and compass and plummet.\n",
        "445": "Everywhere else her art consists alone in throwing down huge masses\ntogether in disorder. You see cones imperfectly formed, irregular\npyramids, with a fantastic disarrangement of lines; but here, as if\nto exhibit an example of regularity, though in advance of the very\nearliest architects, she has created a severely simple order of\narchitecture, never surpassed either by the splendours of Babylon or\nthe wonders of Greece.\nI had heard of the Giant's Causeway in Ireland, and Fingal's Cave in\nStaffa, one of the Hebrides; but I had never yet seen a basaltic\nformation.\n",

        "453": "I don't mean to say anything against these poor priests, who after\nall are very wretched. They receive from the Danish Government a\nridiculously small pittance, and they get from the parish the fourth\npart of the tithe, which does not come to sixty marks a year (about\n\u00a34). Hence the necessity to work for their livelihood; but after\nfishing, hunting, and shoeing horses for any length of time, one soon\ngets into the ways and manners of fishermen, hunters, and farriers,\nand other rather rude and uncultivated people; and that evening I\nfound out that temperance was not among the virtues that\ndistinguished my host.\n",

He cared nothing about fatigue,\nand resolved to spend some days upon the mountain.\n",
        "455": "The preparations for our departure were therefore made the very day\nafter our arrival at Stapi. Hans hired the services of three\nIcelanders to do the duty of the horses in the transport of the\nburdens; but as soon as we had arrived at the crater these natives\nwere to turn back and leave us to our own devices. This was to be\nclearly understood.\n",

        "514": "But I did not try to back out of it. Hans with perfect coolness\nresumed the lead, and I followed him without a word.\nIn order to facilitate the descent, Hans wound his way down the cone\nby a spiral path. Our route lay amidst eruptive rocks, some of which,\n",

        "517": "At mid-day we arrived. I raised my head and saw straight above me the\nupper aperture of the cone, framing a bit of sky of very small\ncircumference, but almost perfectly round. Just upon the edge\nappeared the snowy peak of Saris, standing out sharp and clear\nagainst endless space.\n",
        "518": "At the bottom of the crater were three chimneys, through which, in\nits eruptions, Sn\u00e6fell had driven forth fire and lava from its\ncentral furnace.

I thought his foot must have slipped\n",
        "520": "and that he had fallen down one of the holes. But, no; I saw him,\nwith arms outstretched and legs straddling wide apart, erect before a\ngranite rock that stood in the centre of the crater, just like a\npedestal made ready to receive a statue of Pluto. He stood like a man\nstupefied, but the stupefaction soon gave way to delirious rapture.\n",
        "521": "\"Axel, Axel,\" he cried. \"Come, come!\"\nI ran. Hans and the Icelanders never stirred.\n\"Look!\" cried the Professor.\n",
        "522": "And, sharing his astonishment, but I think not his joy, I read on the\nwestern face of the block, in Runic characters, half mouldered away\nwith lapse of ages, this thrice-accursed name:\n[At this point a Runic text appears]\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" replied my uncle. \"Do you yet doubt?\"\nI made no answer; and I returned in silence to my lava seat in a\nstate of utter speechless consternation.

I had\nneither the wish nor the strength to rise, and following the guide's\nexample I went off into an unhappy slumber, fancying I could hear\nominous noises or feel tremblings within the recesses of the mountain.\n",
        "524": "Thus the first night in the crater passed away.\nThe next morning, a grey, heavy, cloudy sky seemed to droop over the\nsummit of the cone. I did not know this first from the appearances of\nnature, but I found it out by my uncle's impetuous wrath.\n",
        "525": "I soon found out the cause, and hope dawned again in my heart. For\nthis reason.\nOf the three ways open before us, one had been taken by Saknussemm.\n",

Here was June 25. If\n",
        "527": "the sun was clouded for six days we must postpone our visit till next\nyear.\nMy limited powers of description would fail, were I to attempt a\npicture of the Professor's angry impatience.

        "528": "not move from the spot he had selected; yet he must be asking himself\nwhat were we waiting for, if he asked himself anything at all. My\nuncle spoke not a word to me. His gaze, ever directed upwards, was\nlost in the grey and misty space beyond.\n",
        "529": "On the 26th nothing yet. Rain mingled with snow was falling all day\nlong. Hans built a hut of pieces of lava. I felt a malicious pleasure\nin watching the thousand rills and cascades that came tumbling down\nthe sides of the cone, and the deafening continuous din awaked by\nevery stone against which they bounded.\n",
        "530": "My uncle's rage knew no bounds. It was enough to irritate a meeker\nman than he; for it was foundering almost within the port.\nBut Heaven never sends unmixed grief, and for Professor Liedenbrock\nthere was a satisfaction in store proportioned to his desperate\nanxieties.\n",
        "531": "The next day the sky was again overcast; but on the 29th of June, the\nlast day but one of the month, with the change of the moon came a\nchange of weather. The sun poured a flood of light down the crater.\nEvery hillock, every rock and stone, every projecting surface, had\nits share of the beaming torrent, and threw its shadow on the ground.\nAmongst them all, Scartaris laid down his sharp-pointed angular\nshadow which began to move slowly in the opposite direction to that\nof the radiant orb.\n",
        "532": "My uncle turned too, and followed it.\nAt noon, being at its least extent, it came and softly fell upon the\nedge of the middle chimney.\n\"There it is! there it is!\" shouted the Professor.\n",
        "533": "\"Now for the centre of the globe!\" he added in Danish.\nI looked at Hans, to hear what he would say.\n\"_For\u00fct!_\" was his tranquil answer.\n",
        "534": "\"Forward!\" replied my uncle.\nIt was thirteen minutes past one.\nCHAPTER XVII.\n",

        "538": "vacuity laid hold upon me. I felt my centre of gravity shifting its\nplace, and giddiness mounting into my brain like drunkenness. There\nis nothing more treacherous than this attraction down deep abysses. I\n",
        "539": "was just about to drop down, when a hand laid hold of me. It was that\nof Hans. I suppose I had not taken as many lessons on gulf\nexploration as I ought to have done in the Frelsers Kirk at\nCopenhagen.\n",
        "540": "But, however short was my examination of this well, I had taken some\naccount of its conformation. Its almost perpendicular walls were\nbristling with innumerable projections which would facilitate the\ndescent. But if there was no want of steps, still there was no rail.\nA rope fastened to the edge of the aperture might have helped us\ndown. But how were we to unfasten it, when arrived at the other end?\n",
        "541": "My uncle employed a very simple expedient to obviate this difficulty.\nHe uncoiled a cord of the thickness of a finger, and four hundred\nfeet long; first he dropped half of it down, then he passed it round\na lava block that projected conveniently, and threw the other half\ndown the chimney. Each of us could then descend by holding with the\nhand both halves of the rope, which would not be able to unroll\nitself from its hold; when two hundred feet down, it would be easy to\nget possession of the whole of the rope by letting one end go and\npulling down by the other. Then the exercise would go on again _ad\n",

        "543": "Of course, we were not included under that head.\n\"Hans,\" said he, \"will take charge of the tools and a portion of the\nprovisions; you, Axel, will take another third of the provisions, and\nthe arms; and I will take the rest of the provisions and the delicate\ninstruments.\"\n\"But,\" said I, \"the clothes, and that mass of ladders and ropes, what\nis to become of them?\"\n",
        "544": "\"They will go down by themselves.\"\n\"How so?\" I asked.\n\"You will see presently.\"\n",
        "545": "My uncle was always willing to employ magnificent resources. Obeying\norders, Hans tied all the non-fragile articles in one bundle, corded\nthem firmly, and sent them bodily down the gulf before us.\nI listened to the dull thuds of the descending bale. My uncle,\n",
        "546": "leaning over the abyss, followed the descent of the luggage with a\nsatisfied nod, and only rose erect when he had quite lost sight of it.\n\"Very well, now it is our turn.\"\nNow I ask any sensible man if it was possible to hear those words\nwithout a shudder.\n",
        "547": "The Professor fastened his package of instruments upon his shoulders;\nHans took the tools; I took the arms: and the descent commenced in\nthe following order; Hans, my uncle, and myself. It was effected in\nprofound silence, broken only by the descent of loosened stones down\nthe dark gulf.\nI dropped as it were, frantically clutching the double cord with one\nhand and buttressing myself from the wall with the other by means of\nmy stick. One idea overpowered me almost, fear lest the rock should\n",
        "548": "give way from which I was hanging. This cord seemed a fragile thing\nfor three persons to be suspended from. I made as little use of it as\npossible, performing wonderful feats of equilibrium upon the lava\nprojections which my foot seemed to catch hold of like a hand.\n",
        "549": "When one of these slippery steps shook under the heavier form of\nHans, he said in his tranquil voice:\n\"_Gif akt!_\"\n\"Attention!\" repeated my uncle.\nIn half an hour we were standing upon the surface of a rock jammed in\nacross the chimney from one side to the other.\n",
        "550": "Hans pulled the rope by one of its ends, the other rose in the air;\nafter passing the higher rock it came down again, bringing with it a\nrather dangerous shower of bits of stone and lava.\nLeaning over the edge of our narrow standing ground, I observed that\nthe bottom of the hole was still invisible.\nThe same manoeuvre was repeated with the cord, and half an hour after\nwe had descended another two hundred feet.\n",
        "551": "I don't suppose the maddest geologist under such circumstances would\nhave studied the nature of the rocks that we were passing. I am sure\nI did trouble my head about them.

        "555": "lifted my head I perceived the gradual contraction of its aperture.\nIts walls, by a gentle incline, were drawing closer to each other,\nand it was beginning to grow darker.\nStill we kept descending. It seemed to me that the falling stones\n",
        "556": "were meeting with an earlier resistance, and that the concussion gave\na more abrupt and deadened sound.\nAs I had taken care to keep an exact account of our manoeuvres with\nthe rope, which I knew that we had repeated fourteen times, each\ndescent occupying half an hour, the conclusion was easy that we had\nbeen seven hours, plus fourteen quarters of rest, making ten hours\nand a half. We had started at one, it must therefore now be eleven\no'clock; and the depth to which we had descended was fourteen times\n200 feet, or 2,800 feet.\n",
        "557": "At this moment I heard the voice of Hans.\n\"Halt!\" he cried.\nI stopped short just as I was going to place my feet upon my uncle's\nhead.\n",

        "564": "\"No doubt it is very quiet at the bottom of this well, but there is\nsomething alarming in the quietness itself.\"\n\"Now come!\" my uncle cried; \"if you are frightened already, what will\nyou be by and by? We have not gone a single inch yet into the bowels\n",
        "565": "of the earth.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I mean that we have only reached the level of the island, long\nvertical tube, which terminates at the mouth of the crater, has its\nlower end only at the level of the sea.\"\n",
        "566": "\"Are you sure of that?\"\n\"Quite sure. Consult the barometer.\"\nIn fact, the mercury, which had risen in the instrument as fast as we\ndescended, had stopped at twenty-nine inches.\n",
        "567": "\"You see,\" said the Professor, \"we have now only the pressure of our\natmosphere, and I shall be glad when the aneroid takes the place of\nthe barometer.\"\nAnd in truth this instrument would become useless as soon as the\nweight of the atmosphere should exceed the pressure ascertained at\nthe level of the sea.\n\"But,\" I said, \"is there not reason to fear that this ever-increasing\npressure will become at last very painful to bear?\"\n",
        "568": "\"No; we shall descend at a slow rate, and our lungs will become\ninured to a denser atmosphere. Aeronauts find the want of air as they\nrise to high elevations, but we shall perhaps have too much: of the\ntwo, this is what I should prefer. Don't let us lose a moment. Where\nis the bundle we sent down before us?\"\n",
        "569": "I then remembered that we had searched for it in vain the evening\nbefore. My uncle questioned Hans, who, after having examined\nattentively with the eye of a huntsman, replied:\n\"_Der huppe!_\"\n\"Up there.\"\n",
        "570": "And so it was. The bundle had been caught by a projection a hundred\nfeet above us. Immediately the Icelander climbed up like a cat, and\nin a few minutes the package was in our possession.\n",
        "571": "\"Now,\" said my uncle, \"let us breakfast; but we must lay in a good\nstock, for we don't know how long we may have to go on.\"\nThe biscuit and extract of meat were washed down with a draught of\nwater mingled with a little gin.\nBreakfast over, my uncle drew from his pocket a small notebook,\nintended for scientific observations. He consulted his instruments,\n",
        "572": "and recorded:\n\"Monday, July 1.\n\"Chronometer, 8.17 a.m.; barometer, 297 in.; thermometer, 6\u00b0 (43\u00b0\nF.). Direction, E.S.E.\"\n",
        "573": "This last observation applied to the dark gallery, and was indicated\nby the compass.\n\"Now, Axel,\" cried the Professor with enthusiasm, \"now we are really\ngoing into the interior of the earth. At this precise moment the\njourney commences.\"\n",
        "574": "So saying, my uncle took in one hand Ruhmkorff's apparatus, which was\nhanging from his neck; and with the other he formed an electric\ncommunication with the coil in the lantern, and a sufficiently bright\nlight dispersed the darkness of the passage.\nHans carried the other apparatus, which was also put into action.\nThis ingenious application of electricity would enable us to go on\nfor a long time by creating an artificial light even in the midst of\nthe most inflammable gases.\n",
        "575": "\"Now, march!\" cried my uncle.\nEach shouldered his package. Hans drove before him the load of cords\nand clothes; and, myself walking last, we entered the gallery.\n",
        "576": "At the moment of becoming engulfed in this dark gallery, I raised my\nhead, and saw for the last time through the length of that vast tube\nthe sky of Iceland, which I was never to behold again.\nThe lava, in the last eruption of 1229, had forced a passage through\nthis tunnel.

        "579": "Don't you admire those blending hues of lava, passing from reddish\nbrown to bright yellow by imperceptible shades? And these crystals\nare just like globes of light.\"\n\"Ali, you think so, do you, Axel, my boy? Well, you will see greater\n",
        "580": "splendours than these, I hope. Now let us march: march!\"\nHe had better have said slide, for we did nothing but drop down the\nsteep inclines.

        "581": "neither to the right nor to the left.\nYet there was no sensible increase of temperature. This justified\nDavy's theory, and more than once I consulted the thermometer with\nsurprise. Two hours after our departure it only marked 10\u00b0 (50\u00b0\n",
        "582": "Fahr.), an increase of only 4\u00b0. This gave reason for believing that\nour descent was more horizontal than vertical.

        "584": "reached us. What atmospheric disturbance was the cause of them? I\ncould not answer that question at the moment. Hunger and fatigue made\nme incapable of reasoning. A descent of seven hours consecutively is\n",
        "585": "not made without considerable expenditure of strength. I was\nexhausted. The order to 'halt' therefore gave me pleasure. Hans laid\nour provisions upon a block of lava, and we ate with a good appetite.\n",
        "586": "But one thing troubled me, our supply of water was half consumed. My\nuncle reckoned upon a fresh supply from subterranean sources, but\nhitherto we had met with none. I could not help drawing his attention\nto this circumstance.\n",
        "587": "\"Are you surprised at this want of springs?\" he said.\n\"More than that, I am anxious about it; we have only water enough for\nfive days.\"\n\"Don't be uneasy, Axel, we shall find more than we want.\"\n",
        "588": "\"When?\"\n\"When we have left this bed of lava behind us. How could springs\nbreak through such walls as these?\"\n",
        "589": "\"But perhaps this passage runs to a very great depth. It seems to me\nthat we have made no great progress vertically.\"\n\"Why do you suppose that?\"\n",
        "590": "\"Because if we had gone deep into the crust of earth, we should have\nencountered greater heat.\"\n\"According to your system,\" said my uncle. \"But what does the\nthermometer say?\"\n",
        "591": "\"Hardly fifteen degrees (59\u00b0 Fahr), nine degrees only since our\ndeparture.\"\n\"Well, what is your conclusion?\"\n\"This is my conclusion. According to exact observations, the increase\n",
        "592": "of temperature in the interior of the globe advances at the rate of\none degree (1 4/5\u00b0 Fahr.) for every hundred feet. But certain local\nconditions may modify this rate. Thus at Yakoutsk in Siberia the\nincrease of a degree is ascertained to be reached every 36 feet. This\n",
        "593": "difference depends upon the heat-conducting power of the rocks.\nMoreover, in the neighbourhood of an extinct volcano, through gneiss,\nit has been observed that the increase of a degree is only attained\nat every 125 feet. Let us therefore assume this last hypothesis as\nthe most suitable to our situation, and calculate.\"\n",
        "594": "\"Well, do calculate, my boy.\"\n\"Nothing is easier,\" said I, putting down figures in my note book.\n\"Nine times a hundred and twenty-five feet gives a depth of eleven\nhundred and twenty-five feet.\"\n",
        "595": "\"Very accurate indeed.\"\n\"Well?\"\n\"By my observation we are at 10,000 feet below the level of the sea.\"\n",
        "596": "\"Is that possible?\"\n\"Yes, or figures are of no use.\"\nThe Professor's calculations were quite correct. We had already\n",
        "597": "attained a depth of six thousand feet beyond that hitherto reached by\nthe foot of man, such as the mines of Kitz Bahl in Tyrol, and those\nof Wuttembourg in Bohemia.\nThe temperature, which ought to have been 81\u00b0 (178\u00b0 Fahr.) was\nscarcely 15\u00b0 (59\u00b0 Fahr.). Here was cause for reflection.\n",
        "598": "CHAPTER XIX.\nGEOLOGICAL STUDIES IN SITU\nNext day, Tuesday, June 30, at 6 a.m., the descent began again.\nWe were still following the gallery of lava, a real natural\nstaircase, and as gently sloping as those inclined planes which in\nsome old houses are still found instead of flights of steps. And so\n",
        "599": "we went on until 12.17, the, precise moment when we overtook Hans,\nwho had stopped.\n\"Ah! here we are,\" exclaimed my uncle, \"at the very end of the\n",
        "600": "chimney.\"\nI looked around me. We were standing at the intersection of two\nroads, both dark and narrow. Which were we to take? This was a\n",
        "601": "difficulty.\nStill my uncle refused to admit an appearance of hesitation, either\nbefore me or the guide; he pointed out the Eastern tunnel, and we\nwere soon all three in it.\nBesides there would have been interminable hesitation before this\nchoice of roads; for since there was no indication whatever to guide\nour choice, we were obliged to trust to chance.\n",
        "602": "The slope of this gallery was scarcely perceptible, and its sections\nvery unequal. Sometimes we passed a series of arches succeeding each\nother like the majestic arcades of a gothic cathedral. Here the\narchitects of the middle ages might have found studies for every form\nof the sacred art which sprang from the development of the pointed\narch. A mile farther we had to bow our heads under corniced elliptic\n",
        "603": "arches in the romanesque style; and massive pillars standing out from\nthe wall bent under the spring of the vault that rested heavily upon\nthem. In other places this magnificence gave way to narrow channels\nbetween low structures which looked like beaver's huts, and we had to\ncreep along through extremely narrow passages.\nThe heat was perfectly bearable. Involuntarily I began to think of\n",
        "604": "its heat when the lava thrown out by Sn\u00e6fell was boiling and working\nthrough this now silent road. I imagined the torrents of fire hurled\nback at every angle in the gallery, and the accumulation of intensely\nheated vapours in the midst of this confined channel.\nI only hope, thought I, that this so-called extinct volcano won't\ntake a fancy in his old age to begin his sports again!\n",
        "605": "I abstained from communicating these fears to Professor Liedenbrock. He\nwould never have understood them at all. He had but one idea--forward!\nHe walked, he slid, he scrambled, he tumbled, with a persistency which\none could not but admire.\n",
        "606": "By six in the evening, after a not very fatiguing walk, we had gone\ntwo leagues south, but scarcely a quarter of a mile down.\nMy uncle said it was time to go to sleep. We ate without talking, and\nwent to sleep without reflection.\n",
        "607": "Our arrangements for the night were very simple; a railway rug each,\ninto which we rolled ourselves, was our sole covering. We had neither\ncold nor intrusive visits to fear. Travellers who penetrate into the\nwilds of central Africa, and into the pathless forests of the New\nWorld, are obliged to watch over each other by night. But we enjoyed\n",
        "608": "absolute safety and utter seclusion; no savages or wild beasts\ninfested these silent depths.\nNext morning, we awoke fresh and in good spirits. The road was\nresumed. As the day before, we followed the path of the lava. It was\n",
        "609": "impossible to tell what rocks we were passing: the tunnel, instead of\ntending lower, approached more and more nearly to a horizontal\ndirection, I even fancied a slight rise. But about ten this upward\ntendency became so evident, and therefore so fatiguing, that I was\nobliged to slacken my pace.\n\"Well, Axel?\" demanded the Professor impatiently.\n",
        "610": "\"Well, I cannot stand it any longer,\" I replied.\n\"What! after three hours' walk over such easy ground.\"\n\"It may be easy, but it is tiring all the same.\"\n",
        "611": "\"What, when we have nothing to do but keep going down!\"\n\"Going up, if you please.\"\n\"Going up!\" said my uncle, with a shrug.\n",
        "612": "\"No doubt, for the last half-hour the inclines have gone the other\nway, and at this rate we shall soon arrive upon the level soil of\nIceland.\"\nThe Professor nodded slowly and uneasily like a man that declines to\nbe convinced. I tried to resume the conversation. He answered not a\nword, and gave the signal for a start. I saw that his silence was\n",
        "613": "nothing but ill-humour.\nStill I had courageously shouldered my burden again, and was rapidly\nfollowing Hans, whom my uncle preceded. I was anxious not to be left\nbehind. My greatest care was not to lose sight of my companions. I\n",
        "614": "shuddered at the thought of being lost in the mazes of this vast\nsubterranean labyrinth.\nBesides, if the ascending road did become steeper, I was comforted\nwith the thought that it was bringing us nearer to the surface. There\nwas hope in this. Every step confirmed me in it, and I was rejoicing\n",
        "615": "at the thought of meeting my little Gr\u00e4uben again.\nBy mid-day there was a change in the appearance of this wall of the\ngallery. I noticed it by a diminution of the amount of light\nreflected from the sides; solid rock was appearing in the place of\nthe lava coating. The mass was composed of inclined and sometimes\n",
        "616": "vertical strata. We were passing through rocks of the transition or\nsilurian [1] system.\n\"It is evident,\" I cried, \"the marine deposits formed in the second\nperiod, these shales, limestones, and sandstones. We are turning away\n",
        "617": "from the primary granite. We are just as if we were people of Hamburg\ngoing to L\u00fcbeck by way of Hanover!\"\nI had better have kept my observations to myself. But my geological\n",
        "618": "instinct was stronger than my prudence, and uncle Liedenbrock heard\nmy exclamation.\n\"What's that you are saying?\" he asked.\n\"See,\" I said, pointing to the varied series of sandstones and\nlimestones, and the first indication of slate.\n",
        "619": "\"Well?\"\n\"We are at the period when the first plants and animals appeared.\"\n\"Do you think so?\"\n",
        "620": "\"Look close, and examine.\"\nI obliged the Professor to move his lamp over the walls of the\ngallery. I expected some signs of astonishment; but he spoke not a\nword, and went on.\n",
        "621": "Had he understood me or not? Did he refuse to admit, out of self-love\nas an uncle and a philosopher, that he had mistaken his way when he\nchose the eastern tunnel? or was he determined to examine this\npassage to its farthest extremity? It was evident that we had left\n",
        "622": "the lava path, and that this road could not possibly lead to the\nextinct furnace of Sn\u00e6fell.\nYet I asked myself if I was not depending too much on this change in\nthe rock. Might I not myself be mistaken? Were we really crossing the\nlayers of rock which overlie the granite foundation?\n",
        "623": "[1]The name given by Sir Roderick Murchison to a vast series of\nfossiliferous strata, which lies between the non-fossiliferous slaty\nschists below and the old red sandstone above. The system is well\ndeveloped in the region of Shropshire, etc., once inhabited by the\nSilures under Caractacus, or Caradoc. (Tr.)\n",
        "624": "If I am right, I thought, I must soon find some fossil remains of\nprimitive life; and then we must yield to evidence. I will look.\nI had not gone a hundred paces before incontestable proofs presented\nthemselves. It could not be otherwise, for in the Silurian age the\nseas contained at least fifteen hundred vegetable and animal species.\n",
        "625": "My feet, which had become accustomed to the indurated lava floor,\nsuddenly rested upon a dust composed of the _debris_ of plants and\nshells. In the walls were distinct impressions of fucoids and\nlycopodites.\nProfessor Liedenbrock could not be mistaken, I thought, and yet he\npushed on, with, I suppose, his eyes resolutely shut.\n",
        "626": "This was only invincible obstinacy. I could hold out no longer. I\npicked up a perfectly formed shell, which had belonged to an animal\nnot unlike the woodlouse: then, joining my uncle, I said:\n\"Look at this!\"\n\"Very well,\" said he quietly, \"it is the shell of a crustacean, of an\nextinct species called a trilobite. Nothing more.\"\n",
        "627": "\"But don't you conclude--?\"\n\"Just what you conclude yourself. Yes; I do, perfectly. We have left\nthe granite and the lava. It is possible that I may be mistaken. But\n",
        "628": "I cannot be sure of that until I have reached the very end of this\ngallery.\"\n\"You are right in doing this, my uncle, and I should quite approve of\nyour determination, if there were not a danger threatening us nearer\nand nearer.\"\n\"What danger?\"\n",
        "629": "\"The want of water.\"\n\"Well, Axel, we will put ourselves upon rations.\"\nCHAPTER XX.\n",
        "630": "THE FIRST SIGNS OF DISTRESS\nIn fact, we had to ration ourselves. Our provision of water could not\nlast more than three days. I found that out for certain when\nsupper-time came. And, to our sorrow, we had little reason to expect\n",
        "631": "to find a spring in these transition beds.\nThe whole of the next day the gallery opened before us its endless\narcades. We moved on almost without a word. Hans' silence seemed to\nbe infecting us.\n",
        "632": "The road was now not ascending, at least not perceptibly. Sometimes,\neven, it seemed to have a slight fall. But this tendency, which was\nvery trifling, could not do anything to reassure the Professor; for\nthere was no change in the beds, and the transitional characteristics\nbecame more and more decided.\n",
        "633": "The electric light was reflected in sparkling splendour from the\nschist, limestone, and old red sandstone of the walls. It might have\nbeen thought that we were passing through a section of Wales, of\nwhich an ancient people gave its name to this system. Specimens of\nmagnificent marbles clothed the walls, some of a greyish agate\nfantastically veined with white, others of rich crimson or yellow\ndashed with splotches of red; then came dark cherry-coloured marbles\nrelieved by the lighter tints of limestone.\n",
        "634": "The greater part of these bore impressions of primitive organisms.\nCreation had evidently advanced since the day before. Instead of\nrudimentary trilobites, I noticed remains of a more perfect order of\nbeings, amongst others ganoid fishes and some of those sauroids in\nwhich palaeontologists have discovered the earliest reptile forms.\n",
        "635": "The Devonian seas were peopled by animals of these species, and\ndeposited them by thousands in the rocks of the newer formation.\nIt was evident that we were ascending that scale of animal life in\nwhich man fills the highest place. But Professor Liedenbrock seemed\nnot to notice it.\n",
        "636": "He was awaiting one of two events, either the appearance of a\nvertical well opening before his feet, down which our descent might\nbe resumed, or that of some obstacle which should effectually turn us\nback on our own footsteps. But evening came and neither wish was\ngratified.\nOn Friday, after a night during which I felt pangs of thirst, our\nlittle troop again plunged into the winding passages of the gallery.\n",
        "637": "After ten hours' walking I observed a singular deadening of the\nreflection of our lamps from the side walls. The marble, the schist,\nthe limestone, and the sandstone were giving way to a dark and\nlustreless lining. At one moment, the tunnel becoming very narrow, I\nleaned against the wall.\n",
        "638": "When I removed my hand it was black. I looked nearer, and found we\nwere in a coal formation.\n\"A coal mine!\" I cried.\n",
        "639": "\"A mine without miners,\" my uncle replied.\n\"Who knows?\" I asked.\n\"I know,\" the Professor pronounced decidedly, \"I am certain that this\ngallery driven through beds of coal was never pierced by the hand of\nman. But whether it be the hand of nature or not does not matter.\n",
        "640": "Supper time is come; let us sup.\"\nHans prepared some food. I scarcely ate, and I swallowed down the few\ndrops of water rationed out to me. One flask half full was all we had\n",
        "641": "left to slake the thirst of three men.\nAfter their meal my two companions laid themselves down upon their\nrugs, and found in sleep a solace for their fatigue. But I could not\nsleep, and I counted every hour until morning.\n",
        "642": "On Saturday, at six, we started afresh. In twenty minutes we reached\na vast open space; I then knew that the hand of man had not hollowed\nout this mine; the vaults would have been shored up, and, as it was,\nthey seemed to be held up by a miracle of equilibrium.\nThis cavern was about a hundred feet wide and a hundred and fifty in\nheight. A large mass had been rent asunder by a subterranean\n",

Yielding to some vast power from below it had broken\nasunder, leaving this great hollow into which human beings were now\npenetrating for the first time.\nThe whole history of the carboniferous period was written upon these\ngloomy walls, and a geologist might with ease trace all its diverse\nphases.

Perhaps even\n",
        "645": "the orb of day may not have been ready yet to play the splendid part\nhe now acts. There were no 'climates' as yet, and a torrid heat,\nequal from pole to equator, was spread over the whole surface of the\nglobe. Whence this heat?

        "646": "was felt to the very last coats of the terrestrial crust; the plants,\nunacquainted with the beneficent influences of the sun, yielded\nneither flowers nor scent. But their roots drew vigorous life from\nthe burning soil of the early days of this planet.\nThere were but few trees. Herbaceous plants alone existed. There were\n",
        "647": "tall grasses, ferns, lycopods, besides sigillaria, asterophyllites,\nnow scarce plants, but then the species might be counted by thousands.\nThe coal measures owe their origin to this period of profuse\nvegetation. The yet elastic and yielding crust of the earth obeyed\nthe fluid forces beneath. Thence innumerable fissures and\n",
        "648": "depressions. The plants, sunk underneath the waters, formed by\ndegrees into vast accumulated masses.\nThen came the chemical action of nature; in the depths of the seas\nthe vegetable accumulations first became peat; then, acted upon by\ngenerated gases and the heat of fermentation, they underwent a\nprocess of complete mineralization.\n",
        "649": "Thus were formed those immense coalfields, which nevertheless, are\nnot inexhaustible, and which three centuries at the present\naccelerated rate of consumption will exhaust unless the industrial\nworld will devise a remedy.\nThese reflections came into my mind whilst I was contemplating the\nmineral wealth stored up in this portion of the globe.

        "654": "what we are about. We are not in Saknussemm's road, and all we have\nto do is to go back. Let us take a night's rest, and in three days we\nshall get to the fork in the road.\" \"Yes,\" said I, \"if we have any\n",

In\nan hour we had gone a mile and a quarter, and descended two thousand\nfeet.\n",
        "713": "Then I began to hear distinctly quite a new sound of something\nrunning within the thickness of the granite wall, a kind of dull,\ndead rumbling, like distant thunder. During the first part of our\nwalk, not meeting with the promised spring, I felt my agony\nreturning; but then my uncle acquainted me with the cause of the\nstrange noise.\n\"Hans was not mistaken,\" he said. \"What you hear is the rushing of a\n",

Guided by\nan instinct peculiar to mountaineers he had as it were felt this\ntorrent through the rock; but he had certainly seen none of the\nprecious liquid; he had drunk nothing himself.\nSoon it became evident that if we continued our walk we should widen\nthe distance between ourselves and the stream, the noise of which was\nbecoming fainter.\n",
        "718": "We returned. Hans stopped where the torrent seemed closest. I sat\nnear the wall, while the waters were flowing past me at a distance of\ntwo feet with extreme violence. But there was a thick granite wall\nbetween us and the object of our desires.\n",
        "719": "Without reflection, without asking if there were any means of\nprocuring the water, I gave way to a movement of despair.\nHans glanced at me with, I thought, a smile of compassion.\nHe rose and took the lamp. I followed him. He moved towards the wall.\n",

        "729": "\"The water is at the boiling point,\" I cried.\n\"Well, never mind, let it cool,\" my uncle replied.\nThe tunnel was filling with steam, whilst a stream was forming, which\nby degrees wandered away into subterranean windings, and soon we had\nthe satisfaction of swallowing our first draught.\n",
        "730": "Could anything be more delicious than the sensation that our burning\nintolerable thirst was passing away, and leaving us to enjoy comfort\nand pleasure? But where was this water from? No matter. It was water;\nand though still warm, it brought life back to the dying. I kept\ndrinking without stopping, and almost without tasting.\n",
        "731": "At last after a most delightful time of reviving energy, I cried,\n\"Why, this is a chalybeate spring!\"\n\"Nothing could be better for the digestion,\" said my uncle. \"It is\nhighly impregnated with iron. It will be as good for us as going to\n",

        "734": "\"Agreed,\" I cried.\nAnd Hansbach it was from that moment.\nHans was none the prouder. After a moderate draught, he went quietly\n",
        "735": "into a corner to rest.\n\"Now,\" I said, \"we must not lose this water.\"\n\"What is the use of troubling ourselves?\" my uncle, replied. \"I fancy\n",
        "736": "it will never fail.\"\n\"Never mind, we cannot be sure; let us fill the water bottle and our\nflasks, and then stop up the opening.\"\nMy advice was followed so far as getting in a supply; but the\nstopping up of the hole was not so easy to accomplish. It was in vain\n",
        "737": "that we took up fragments of granite, and stuffed them in with tow,\nwe only scalded our hands without succeeding. The pressure was too\ngreat, and our efforts were fruitless.\n\"It is quite plain,\" said I, \"that the higher body of this water is\nat a considerable elevation. The force of the jet shows that.\"\n",
        "738": "\"No doubt,\" answered my uncle. \"If this column of water is 32,000\nfeet high--that is, from the surface of the earth, it is equal to\nthe weight of a thousand atmospheres. But I have got an idea.\"\n\"Well?\"\n",

        "744": "WELL SAID, OLD MOLE! CANST THOU WORK I' THE GROUND SO FAST?\nBy the next day we had forgotten all our sufferings. At first, I was\nwondering that I was no longer thirsty, and I was for asking for the\nreason. The answer came in the murmuring of the stream at my feet.\n",
        "745": "We breakfasted, and drank of this excellent chalybeate water. I felt\nwonderfully stronger, and quite decided upon pushing on.

        "747": "\"Let us start!\" I cried, awakening by my shouts the echoes of the\nvaulted hollows of the earth.\nOn Thursday, at 8 a.m., we started afresh. The granite tunnel winding\n",
        "748": "from side to side, earned us past unexpected turns, and seemed almost\nto form a labyrinth; but, on the whole, its direction seemed to be\nsouth-easterly. My uncle never ceased to consult his compass, to keep\naccount of the ground gone over.\nThe gallery dipped down a very little way from the horizontal,\nscarcely more than two inches in a fathom, and the stream ran gently\nmurmuring at our feet. I compared it to a friendly genius guiding us\n",
        "749": "underground, and caressed with my hand the soft naiad, whose\ncomforting voice accompanied our steps. With my reviving spirits\nthese mythological notions seemed to come unbidden.\nAs for my uncle, he was beginning to storm against the horizontal\nroad. He loved nothing better than a vertical path; but this way\n",
        "750": "seemed indefinitely prolonged, and instead of sliding along the\nhypothenuse as we were now doing, he would willingly have dropped\ndown the terrestrial radius. But there was no help for it, and as\nlong as we were approaching the centre at all we felt that we must\nnot complain.\nFrom time to time, a steeper path appeared; our naiad then began to\ntumble before us with a hoarser murmur, and we went down with her to\na greater depth.\n",
        "751": "On the whole, that day and the next we made considerable way\nhorizontally, very little vertically.\nOn Friday evening, the 10th of July, according to our calculations,\nwe were thirty leagues south-east of Rejkiavik, and at a depth of two\nleagues and a half.\nAt our feet there now opened a frightful abyss. My uncle, however,\n",
        "752": "was not to be daunted, and he clapped his hands at the steepness of\nthe descent.\n\"This will take us a long way,\" he cried, \"and without much\ndifficulty; for the projections in the rock form quite a staircase.\"\nThe ropes were so fastened by Hans as to guard against accident, and\nthe descent commenced. I can hardly call it perilous, for I was\n",
        "753": "beginning to be familiar with this kind of exercise.\nThis well, or abyss, was a narrow cleft in the mass of the granite,\ncalled by geologists a 'fault,' and caused by the unequal cooling of\nthe globe of the earth. If it had at one time been a passage for\neruptive matter thrown out by Sn\u00e6fell, I still could not understand\nwhy no trace was left of its passage. We kept going down a kind of\n",
        "754": "winding staircase, which seemed almost to have been made by the hand\nof man.\nEvery quarter of an hour we were obliged to halt, to take a little\nnecessary repose and restore the action of our limbs. We then sat\ndown upon a fragment of rock, and we talked as we ate and drank from\nthe stream.\n",
        "755": "Of course, down this fault the Hansbach fell in a cascade, and lost\nsome of its volume; but there was enough and to spare to slake our\nthirst. Besides, when the incline became more gentle, it would of\ncourse resume its peaceable course. At this moment it reminded me of\nmy worthy uncle, in his frequent fits of impatience and anger, while\nbelow it ran with the calmness of the Icelandic hunter.\n",
        "756": "On the 6th and 7th of July we kept following the spiral curves of\nthis singular well, penetrating in actual distance no more than two\nleagues; but being carried to a depth of five leagues below the level\nof the sea. But on the 8th, about noon, the fault took, towards the\nsouth-east, a much gentler slope, one of about forty-five degrees.\nThen the road became monotonously easy. It could not be otherwise,\n",
        "757": "for there was no landscape to vary the stages of our journey.\nOn Wednesday, the 15th, we were seven leagues underground, and had\ntravelled fifty leagues away from Sn\u00e6fell. Although we were tired,\nour health was perfect, and the medicine chest had not yet had\noccasion to be opened.\n",
        "758": "My uncle noted every hour the indications of the compass, the\nchronometer, the aneroid, and the thermometer the very same which he\nhas published in his scientific report of our journey. It was\ntherefore not difficult to know exactly our whereabouts. When he told\nme that we had gone fifty leagues horizontally, I could not repress\nan exclamation of astonishment, at the thought that we had now long\nleft Iceland behind us.\n",
        "759": "\"What is the matter?\" he cried.\n\"I was reflecting that if your calculations are correct we are no\nlonger under Iceland.\"\n\"Do you think so?\"\n",
        "760": "\"I am not mistaken,\" I said, and examining the map, I added, \"We have\npassed Cape Portland, and those fifty leagues bring us under the wide\nexpanse of ocean.\"\n\"Under the sea,\" my uncle repeated, rubbing his hands with delight.\n\"Can it be?\" I said. \"Is the ocean spread above our heads?\"\n",
        "761": "\"Of course, Axel. What can be more natural? At Newcastle are there\nnot coal mines extending far under the sea?\"\nIt was all very well for the Professor to call this so simple, but I\ncould not feel quite easy at the thought that the boundless ocean was\nrolling over my head. And yet it really mattered very little whether\n",
        "762": "it was the plains and mountains that covered our heads, or the\nAtlantic waves, as long as we were arched over by solid granite. And,\nbesides, I was getting used to this idea; for the tunnel, now running\nstraight, now winding as capriciously in its inclines as in its\nturnings, but constantly preserving its south-easterly direction, and\nalways running deeper, was gradually carrying us to very great depths\nindeed.\nFour days later, Saturday, the 18th of July, in the evening, we\narrived at a kind of vast grotto; and here my uncle paid Hans his\nweekly wages, and it was settled that the next day, Sunday, should be\na day of rest.\n",
        "763": "CHAPTER XXV.\nDE PROFUNDIS\nI therefore awoke next day relieved from the preoccupation of an\nimmediate start. Although we were in the very deepest of known\ndepths, there was something not unpleasant about it. And, besides, we\n",
        "764": "were beginning to get accustomed to this troglodyte [1] life. I no\nlonger thought of sun, moon, and stars, trees, houses, and towns, nor\nof any of those terrestrial superfluities which are necessaries of\nmen who live upon the earth's surface. Being fossils, we looked upon\nall those things as mere jokes.\n",
        "765": "The grotto was an immense apartment. Along its granite floor ran our\nfaithful stream. At this distance from its spring the water was\nscarcely tepid, and we drank of it with pleasure.\n",
        "766": "After breakfast the Professor gave a few hours to the arrangement of\nhis daily notes.\n\"First,\" said he, \"I will make a calculation to ascertain our exact\nposition. I hope, after our return, to draw a map of our journey,\nwhich will be in reality a vertical section of the globe, containing\nthe track of our expedition.\"\n",
        "767": "\"That will be curious, uncle; but are your observations sufficiently\naccurate to enable you to do this correctly?\"\n\"Yes; I have everywhere observed the angles and the inclines. I am\nsure there is no error. Let us see where we are now. Take your\n",

        "770": "\"Therefore we are under mid-Atlantic?\"\n\"To be sure we are.\"\n\"And perhaps at this very moment there is a storm above, and ships\nover our heads are being rudely tossed by the tempest.\"\n",
        "771": "\"Quite probable.\"\n\"And whales are lashing the roof of our prison with their tails?\"\n\"It may be, Axel, but they won't shake us here. But let us go back to\n",
        "772": "our calculation. Here we are eighty-five leagues south-east of\nSn\u00e6fell, and I reckon that we are at a depth of sixteen leagues.\"\n\"Sixteen leagues?\" I cried.\n",
        "773": "\"No doubt.\"\n\"Why, this is the very limit assigned by science to the thickness of\nthe crust of the earth.\"\n\"I don't deny it.\"\n",

        "785": "\"Now look at your aneroid. What does that say?\"\n\"It says we are under considerable pressure.\"\n\"Very good; so you see that by going gradually down, and getting\naccustomed to the density of the atmosphere, we don't suffer at all.\"\n",

        "788": "\"But won't this density augment?\"\n\"Yes; according to a rather obscure law. It is well known that the\nweight of bodies diminishes as fast as we descend. You know that it\n",

My uncle would have met it with\nhis inevitable Saknussemm, a precedent which possessed no weight with\nme; for even if the journey of the learned Icelander were really\nattested, there was one very simple answer, that in the sixteenth\ncentury there was neither barometer or aneroid and therefore\nSaknussemm could not tell how far he had gone.\n",

        "1190": "importance of this discovery, proved to demonstration the genuineness of\nthe bone in question, and became the most ardent defendants in what the\nEnglish called this 'trial of a jawbone.' To the geologists of the\nUnited Kingdom, who believed in the certainty of the fact--Messrs.\nFalconer, Busk, Carpenter, and others--scientific Germans were soon\njoined, and amongst them the forwardest, the most fiery, and the most\nenthusiastic, was my uncle Liedenbrock.\n",
        "1191": "Therefore the genuineness of a fossil human relic of the quaternary\nperiod seemed to be incontestably proved and admitted.\nIt is true that this theory met with a most obstinate opponent in M.\nElie de Beaumont. This high authority maintained that the soil of\n",

My uncle Liedenbrock, along with the great body of\nthe geologists, had maintained his ground, disputed, and argued,\nuntil M. Elie de Beaumont stood almost alone in his opinion.\nWe knew all these details, but we were not aware that since our\ndeparture the question had advanced to farther stages. Other similar\n",
        "1193": "maxillaries, though belonging to individuals of various types and\ndifferent nations, were found in the loose grey soil of certain\ngrottoes in France, Switzerland, and Belgium, as well as weapons,\ntools, earthen utensils, bones of children and adults.

It is true that these remains\nwere not human bones, but objects bearing the traces of his\nhandiwork, such as fossil leg-bones of animals, sculptured and carved\nevidently by the hand of man.\nThus, at one bound, the record of the existence of man receded far\nback into the history of the ages past; he was a predecessor of the\nmastodon; he was a contemporary of the southern elephant; he lived a\nhundred thousand years ago, when, according to geologists, the\npleiocene formation was in progress.\n",
        "1195": "Such then was the state of pal\u00e6ontological science, and what we knew\nof it was sufficient to explain our behaviour in the presence of this\nstupendous Golgotha. Any one may now understand the frenzied\nexcitement of my uncle, when, twenty yards farther on, he found\nhimself face to face with a primitive man!\nIt was a perfectly recognisable human body.

        "1211": "\"Yes,\" he pursued with animation, \"this is a fossil man, the\ncontemporary of the mastodons whose remains fill this amphitheatre.\nBut if you ask me how he came there, how those strata on which he lay\nslipped down into this enormous hollow in the globe, I confess I\ncannot answer that question. No doubt in the post-tertiary period\nconsiderable commotions were still disturbing the crust of the earth.\n",
        "1212": "The long-continued cooling of the globe produced chasms, fissures,\nclefts, and faults, into which, very probably, portions of the upper\nearth may have fallen. I make no rash assertions; but there is the\nman surrounded by his own works, by hatchets, by flint arrow-heads,\nwhich are the characteristics of the stone age.

        "1245": "\"It is difficult to speak decidedly, uncle, for all these rocks are\nso very much alike. Yet I think I recognise the promontory at the\nfoot of which Hans constructed our launch.

        "1246": "\"No, Axel, we should at least find our own traces and I see nothing--\"\n\"But I do see,\" I cried, darting upon an object lying on the sand.\nAnd I showed my uncle a rusty dagger which I had just picked up.\n\"Come,\" said he, \"had you this weapon with you?\"\n",
        "1247": "\"I! No, certainly! But you, perhaps--\"\n\"Not that I am aware,\" said the Professor. \"I have never had this\nobject in my possession.\"\n",

        "1301": "We all three fell down flat. In less than a second we were in deep,\nunfathomable darkness. Then I felt as if not only myself but the raft\nalso had no support beneath. I thought it was sinking; but it was not\n",

        "1304": "An hour passed away--two hours, perhaps--I cannot tell. We clutched\neach other fast, to save ourselves from being thrown off the raft. We\nfelt violent shocks whenever we were borne heavily against the craggy\nprojections. Yet these shocks were not very frequent, from which I\n",

        "1306": "ideas together during this headlong race, which seemed like a\nvertical descent. To judge by the air which was whistling past me and\nmade a whizzing in my ears, we were moving faster than the fastest\nexpress trains.

        "1350": "But as soon as the meal was done, we each of us fell deep into\nthought. What was Hans thinking of--that man of the far West, but\nwho seemed ruled by the fatalist doctrines of the East?\nAs for me, my thoughts were made up of remembrances, and they carried\nme up to the surface of the globe of which I ought never to have\ntaken leave.

        "1352": "This calculation could, at best, be but a vague approximation; but a\nlearned man is always a philosopher when he succeeds in remaining\ncool, and assuredly Professor Liedenbrock possessed this quality to a\nsurprising degree.\nI could hear him murmuring geological terms.

        "1359": "which the boldest spirit must quail. A dim, vague notion laid hold of\nmy mind, but which was fast hardening into certainty. I tried to\nrepel it, but it would return. I dared not express it in plain terms.\n",
        "1360": "Yet a few involuntary observations confirmed me in my view. By the\nflickering light of the torch I could distinguish contortions in the\ngranite beds; a phenomenon was unfolding in which electricity would\nplay the principal part; then this unbearable heat, this boiling\nwater!

A\nphenomenon of this kind would not have greatly alarmed me, or at any\nrate it would not have given rise to dreadful apprehensions.\nBut other facts, other circumstances, of a peculiar nature, came to\nreveal to me by degrees the true state of the case.

        "1371": "what was the use of saying facetious things at a time like this?\n\"What!\" I shouted. \"Are we being taken up in an eruption? Our fate\nhas flung us here among burning lavas, molten rocks, boiling waters,\nand all kinds of volcanic matter; we are going to be pitched out,\nexpelled, tossed up, vomited, spit out high into the air, along with\nfragments of rock, showers of ashes and scoria, in the midst of a\ntowering rush of smoke and flames; and it is the best thing that\ncould happen to us!\"\n",

        "1373": "In the meantime up we went; the night passed away in continual\nascent; the din and uproar around us became more and more\nintensified; I was stifled and stunned; I thought my last hour was\napproaching; and yet imagination is such a strong thing that even in\nthis supreme hour I was occupied with strange and almost childish\nspeculations. But I was the victim, not the master, of my own\nthoughts.\nIt was very evident that we were being hurried upward upon the crest\nof a wave of eruption; beneath our raft were boiling waters, and\nunder these the more sluggish lava was working its way up in a heated\nmass, together with shoals of fragments of rock which, when they\narrived at the crater, would be dispersed in all directions high and\nlow. We were imprisoned in the shaft or chimney of some volcano.\n",
        "1374": "There was no room to doubt of that.\nBut this time, instead of Sn\u00e6fell, an extinct volcano, we were inside\none in full activity. I wondered, therefore, where could this\nmountain be, and in what part of the world we were to be shot out.\n",
        "1375": "I made no doubt but that it would be in some northern region. Before\nits disorders set in, the needle had never deviated from that\ndirection. From Cape Saknussemm we had been carried due north for\nhundreds of leagues. Were we under Iceland again? Were we destined to\n",

        "1378": "heat increased, instead of diminishing, as we approached nearer to\nthe surface of the globe, this effect was due to local causes alone,\nand those volcanic. The manner of our locomotion left no doubt in my\nmind. An enormous force, a force of hundreds of atmospheres,\ngenerated by the extreme pressure of confined vapours, was driving us\nirresistibly forward. But to what numberless dangers it exposed us!\n",
        "1379": "Soon lurid lights began to penetrate the vertical gallery which\nwidened as we went up. Right and left I could see deep channels, like\nhuge tunnels, out of which escaped dense volumes of smoke; tongues of\nfire lapped the walls, which crackled and sputtered under the intense\nheat.\n\"See, see, my uncle!\" I cried.\n",
        "1380": "\"Well, those are only sulphureous flames and vapours, which one must\nexpect to see in an eruption. They are quite natural.\"\n\"But suppose they should wrap us round.\"\n\"But they won't wrap us round.\"\n",
        "1381": "\"But we shall be stifled.\"\n\"We shall not be stifled at all. The gallery is widening, and if it\nbecomes necessary, we shall abandon the raft, and creep into a\ncrevice.\"\n",
        "1382": "\"But the water--the rising water?\"\n\"There is no more water, Axel; only a lava paste, which is bearing us\nup on its surface to the top of the crater.\"\nThe liquid column had indeed disappeared, to give place to dense and\nstill boiling eruptive matter of all kinds. The temperature was\n",
        "1383": "becoming unbearable. A thermometer exposed to this atmosphere would\nhave marked 150\u00b0. The perspiration streamed from my body. But for the\nrapidity of our ascent we should have been suffocated.\n",
        "1384": "But the Professor gave up his idea of abandoning the raft, and it was\nwell he did. However roughly joined together, those planks afforded\nus a firmer support than we could have found anywhere else.\nAbout eight in the morning a new incident occurred. The upward\n",
        "1385": "movement ceased. The raft lay motionless.\n\"What is this?\" I asked, shaken by this sudden stoppage as if by a\nshock.\n",
        "1386": "\"It is a halt,\" replied my uncle.\n\"Is the eruption checked?\" I asked.\n\"I hope not.\"\n",
        "1387": "I rose, and tried to look around me. Perhaps the raft itself, stopped\nin its course by a projection, was staying the volcanic torrent. If\nthis were the case we should have to release it as soon as possible.\n",
        "1388": "But it was not so. The blast of ashes, scorix, and rubbish had ceased\nto rise.\n\"Has the eruption stopped?\" I cried.\n",
        "1389": "\"Ah!\" said my uncle between his clenched teeth, \"you are afraid. But\ndon't alarm yourself--this lull cannot last long. It has lasted now\nfive minutes, and in a short time we shall resume our journey to the\nmouth of the crater.\"\n",
        "1390": "As he spoke, the Professor continued to consult his chronometer, and\nhe was again right in his prognostications. The raft was soon hurried\nand driven forward with a rapid but irregular movement, which lasted\nabout ten minutes, and then stopped again.\n\"Very good,\" said my uncle; \"in ten minutes more we shall be off\nagain, for our present business lies with an intermittent volcano. It\n",
        "1391": "gives us time now and then to take breath.\"\nThis was perfectly true. When the ten minutes were over we started\noff again with renewed and increased speed. We were obliged to lay\n",

We had come out of the crater\nhalf naked, and the radiant orb to which we had been strangers for\ntwo months was lavishing upon us out of his blazing splendours more\nof his light and heat than we were able to receive with comfort.\n",
        "1403": "When my eyes had become accustomed to the bright light to which they\nhad been so long strangers, I began to use them to set my imagination\nright.

        "1405": "Above our heads, at a height of five hundred feet or more, we saw the\ncrater of a volcano, through which, at intervals of fifteen minutes\nor so, there issued with loud explosions lofty columns of fire,\nmingled with pumice stones, ashes, and flowing lava. I could feel the\nheaving of the mountain, which seemed to breathe like a huge whale,\nand puff out fire and wind from its vast blowholes.

        "1418": "\"Ah!\" I cried, \"here is an inhabitant of this happy land!\"\nIt was but a poor boy, miserably ill-clad, a sufferer from poverty,\nand our aspect seemed to alarm him a great deal; in fact, only half\nclothed, with ragged hair and beards, we were a suspicious-looking\nparty; and if the people of the country knew anything about thieves,\nwe were very likely to frighten them.\nJust as the poor little wretch was going to take to his heels, Hans\ncaught hold of him, and brought him to us, kicking and struggling.\n",

        "1431": "be simply disgraceful!\"\nAnd as he spoke, my uncle, half undressed, in rags, a perfect\nscarecrow, with his leathern belt around him, settling his spectacles\nupon his nose and looking learned and imposing, was himself again,\nthe terrible German professor of mineralogy.\nOne hour after we had left the grove of olives, we arrived at the\nlittle port of San Vicenzo, where Hans claimed his thirteen week's\nwages, which was counted out to him with a hearty shaking of hands\nall round.\n",
        "1432": "At that moment, if he did not share our natural emotion, at least his\ncountenance expanded in a manner very unusual with him, and while\nwith the ends of his fingers he lightly pressed our hands, I believe\nhe smiled.\nCHAPTER XLV.\nALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL\nSuch is the conclusion of a history which I cannot expect everybody\nto believe, for some people will believe nothing against the\ntestimony of their own experience.

        "1434": "st of August, a small craft took us to Messina, where a few days'\nrest completely removed the effect of our fatigues.\nOn Friday, September the 4th, we embarked on the steamer Volturno,\nemployed by the French Messageries Imperiales, and in three days more\nwe were at Marseilles, having no care on our minds except that\nabominable deceitful compass, which we had mislaid somewhere and\ncould not now examine; but its inexplicable behaviour exercised my\nmind fearfully. On the 9th of September, in the evening, we arrived\nat Hamburg.\n",
        "1435": "I cannot describe to you the astonishment of Martha or the joy of\nGr\u00e4uben.\n\"Now you are a hero, Axel,\" said to me my blushing _fianc\u00e9e,_ my\nbetrothed, \"you will not leave me again!\"\nI looked tenderly upon her, and she smiled through her tears.\n",
        "1436": "How can I describe the extraordinary sensation produced by the return\nof Professor Liedenbrock? Thanks to Martha's ineradicable tattling,\nthe news that the Professor had gone to discover a way to the centre\nof the earth had spread over the whole civilised world. People\nrefused to believe it, and when they saw him they would not believe\nhim any the more. Still, the appearance of Hans, and sundry pieces of\n",

        "1438": "to the Professor at the Johann\u00e6um, at which he told all about our\nexpedition, with only one omission, the unexplained and inexplicable\nbehaviour of our compass. On the same day, with much state, he\ndeposited in the archives of the city the now famous document of\nSaknussemm, and expressed his regret that circumstances over which he\nhad no control had prevented him from following to the very centre of\nthe earth the track of the learned Icelander. He was modest\nnotwithstanding his glory, and he was all the more famous for his\nhumility.\n",
        "1439": "So much honour could not but excite envy. There were those who envied\nhim his fame; and as his theories, resting upon known facts, were in\nopposition to the systems of science upon the question of the central\nfire, he sustained with his pen and by his voice remarkable\ndiscussions with the learned of every country.\nFor my part I cannot agree with his theory of gradual cooling: in\nspite of what I have seen and felt, I believe, and always shall\nbelieve, in the central heat. But I admit that certain circumstances\n",
        "1440": "not yet sufficiently understood may tend to modify in places the\naction of natural phenomena.\nWhile these questions were being debated with great animation, my\nuncle met with a real sorrow.

He was seized with the mal de pays, a complaint for which we\n",
        "1441": "have not even a name in English.\n\"_Farval,_\" said he one day; and with that simple word he left us and\nsailed for Rejkiavik, which he reached in safety.\nWe were strongly attached to our brave eider-down hunter; though far\naway in the remotest north, he will never be forgotten by those whose\nlives he protected, and certainly I shall not fail to endeavour to\nsee him once more before I die.\n",
        "1442": "To conclude, I have to add that this 'Journey into the Interior of\nthe Earth' created a wonderful sensation in the world. It was\ntranslated into all civilised languages. The leading newspapers\nextracted the most interesting passages, which were commented upon,\npicked to pieces, discussed, attacked, and defended with equal\nenthusiasm and determination, both by believers and sceptics. Rare\n",
        "1443": "privilege! my uncle enjoyed during his lifetime the glory he had\ndeservedly won; and he may even boast the distinguished honour of an\noffer from Mr. Barnum, to exhibit him on most advantageous terms in\nall the principal cities in the United States!\n",
        "1444": "But there was one 'dead fly' amidst all this glory and honour; one\nfact, one incident, of the journey remained a mystery. Now to a man\neminent for his learning, an unexplained phenomenon is an unbearable\nhardship. Well! it was yet reserved for my uncle to be completely\nhappy.\n",
        "1445": "One day, while arranging a collection of minerals in his cabinet, I\nnoticed in a corner this unhappy compass, which we had long lost\nsight of; I opened it, and began to watch it.\nIt had been in that corner for six months, little mindful of the\ntrouble it was giving.\nSuddenly, to my intense astonishment, I noticed a strange fact, and I\nuttered a cry of surprise.\n",
        "1446": "\"What is the matter?\" my uncle asked.\n\"That compass!\"\n\"Well?\"\n",
        "1447": "\"See, its poles are reversed!\"\n\"Reversed?\"\n\"Yes, they point the wrong way.\"\n",
        "1448": "My uncle looked, he compared, and the house shook with his triumphant\nleap of exultation.\nA light broke in upon his spirit and mine.\n\"See there,\" he cried, as soon as he was able to speak. \"After our\n",
        "1449": "arrival at Cape Saknussemm the north pole of the needle of this\nconfounded compass began to point south instead of north.\"\n\"Evidently!\"\n\"Here, then, is the explanation of our mistake. But what phenomenon\n",
        "1450": "could have caused this reversal of the poles?\"\n\"The reason is evident, uncle.\"\n\"Tell me, then, Axel.\"\n",
        "1451": "\"During the electric storm on the Liedenbrock sea, that ball of fire,\nwhich magnetised all the iron on board, reversed the poles of our\nmagnet!\"\n\"Aha! aha!\" shouted the Professor with a loud laugh. \"So it was just\nan electric joke!\"\n",
        "1452": "From that day forth the Professor was the most glorious of savants,\nand I was the happiest of men; for my pretty Virlandaise, resigning\nher place as ward, took her position in the old house on the\nK\u00f6nigstrasse in the double capacity of niece to my uncle and wife to\na certain happy youth. What is the need of adding that the\nillustrious Otto Liedenbrock, corresponding member of all the\nscientific, geographical, and mineralogical societies of all the\ncivilised world, was now her uncle and mine?\n"
