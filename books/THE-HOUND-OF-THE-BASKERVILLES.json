        "255": "      it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk.\u201d\n      He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which\n      divided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards\n      behind, we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street.\n",
        "256": "      Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon\n      which Holmes did the same. An instant afterwards he gave a little\n      cry of satisfaction, and, following the direction of his eager\n      eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man inside which had halted\n      on the other side of the street was now proceeding slowly onward\n      again.\n      \u201cThere\u2019s our man, Watson! Come along! We\u2019ll have a good look at\n",

        "259": "      with vexation from the tide of vehicles. \u201cWas ever such bad luck\n      and such bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an\n      honest man you will record this also and set it against my\n      successes!\u201d\n",

How else could it be known so quickly that it was the\n      Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen? If they had followed\n      him the first day I argued that they would follow him also the\n      second. You may have observed that I twice strolled over to the\n",

This matter cuts very\n      deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is\n      a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I\n      am conscious always of power and design. When our friends left I\n      at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their\n      invisible attendant. So wily was he that he had not trusted\n",
        "264": "      himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so that he\n      could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice.\n      His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take\n      a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one\n      obvious disadvantage.\u201d\n",
        "265": "      \u201cIt puts him in the power of the cabman.\u201d\n      \u201cExactly.\u201d\n      \u201cWhat a pity we did not get the number!\u201d\n",

        "267": "      \u201cOn observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked\n      in the other direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a\n      second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance, or,\n      better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited\n      there. When our unknown had followed Baskerville home we should\n      have had the opportunity of playing his own game upon himself and\n      seeing where he made for. As it is, by an indiscreet eagerness,\n",

There is an opening between two trees which enables one\n      from this point of view to look right down upon it, while from\n      all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be\n      obtained.

A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, and\n      another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man\n      who was moving among the broken ground. It was Stapleton with his\n      butterfly-net. He was very much closer to the pair than I was,\n",

He was very\n      sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish and\n      how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a\n      beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life.

We had heard the creak of a\n      step in the passage.\n",
        "638": "      Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the\n      distance. Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out\n      in pursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and the\n      corridor was all in darkness. Softly we stole along until we had\n",

We had taken the\n      precaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old\n      boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread. Sometimes it seemed\n      impossible that he should fail to hear our approach. However, the\n",

When at last we reached the door and\n      peeped through we found him crouching at the window, candle in\n      hand, his white, intent face pressed against the pane, exactly as\n      I had seen him two nights before.\n      We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to\n      whom the most direct way is always the most natural. He walked\n",

His dark eyes, glaring out of the white\n      mask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as he\n      gazed from Sir Henry to me.\n      \u201cWhat are you doing here, Barrymore?\u201d\n",
        "643": "      \u201cNothing, sir.\u201d His agitation was so great that he could hardly\n      speak, and the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his\n      candle. \u201cIt was the window, sir. I go round at night to see that\n      they are fastened.\u201d\n",

Come, now! No lies!\n",
        "645": "      What were you doing at that window?\u201d\n      The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands\n      together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and\n      misery.\n      \u201cI was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the window.\u201d\n",

        "675": "      \u201cI have a hunting-crop.\u201d\n      \u201cWe must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a\n      desperate fellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him at\n      our mercy before he can resist.\u201d\n",

How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil\n      is exalted?\u201d\n      As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast\n      gloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon\n      the borders of the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the wind\n",
        "677": "      through the silence of the night, a long, deep mutter, then a\n      rising howl, and then the sad moan in which it died away. Again\n      and again it sounded, the whole air throbbing with it, strident,\n      wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my sleeve and his face\n      glimmered white through the darkness.\n",

        "679": "      It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood\n      straining our ears, but nothing came.\n      \u201cWatson,\u201d said the baronet, \u201cit was the cry of a hound.\u201d\n",
        "680": "      My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice\n      which told of the sudden horror which had seized him.\n      \u201cWhat do they call this sound?\u201d he asked.\n      \u201cWho?\u201d\n",
        "681": "      \u201cThe folk on the countryside.\u201d\n      \u201cOh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they call\n      it?\u201d\n",

        "683": "      He groaned and was silent for a few moments.\n      \u201cA hound it was,\u201d he said at last, \u201cbut it seemed to come from\n      miles away, over yonder, I think.\u201d\n      \u201cIt was hard to say whence it came.\u201d\n",
        "684": "      \u201cIt rose and fell with the wind. Isn\u2019t that the direction of the\n      great Grimpen Mire?\u201d\n      \u201cYes, it is.\u201d\n",
        "685": "      \u201cWell, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn\u2019t you think\n      yourself that it was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. You\n      need not fear to speak the truth.\u201d\n",
        "686": "      \u201cStapleton was with me when I heard it last. He said that it\n      might be the calling of a strange bird.\u201d\n      \u201cNo, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth in all\n",
        "687": "      these stories? Is it possible that I am really in danger from so\n      dark a cause? You don\u2019t believe it, do you, Watson?\u201d\n      \u201cNo, no.\u201d\n",

And my uncle! There was the footprint of the\n      hound beside him as he lay. It all fits together. I don\u2019t think\n      that I am a coward, Watson, but that sound seemed to freeze my\n      very blood. Feel my hand!\u201d\n",

        "690": "      advise that we do now?\u201d\n      \u201cShall we turn back?\u201d\n      \u201cNo, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do\n      it. We after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not,\n",
        "691": "      after us. Come on! We\u2019ll see it through if all the fiends of the\n      pit were loose upon the moor.\u201d\n      We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of\n      the craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning\n      steadily in front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance\n",
        "692": "      of a light upon a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer\n      seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes it might\n      have been within a few yards of us. But at last we could see\n      whence it came, and then we knew that we were indeed very close.\n      A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which\n      flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also\n      to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of\n      Baskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach,\n",
        "693": "      and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. It\n      was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle\n      of the moor, with no sign of life near it\u2014just the one straight\n      yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it.\n      \u201cWhat shall we do now?\u201d whispered Sir Henry.\n",
        "694": "      \u201cWait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a\n      glimpse of him.\u201d\n      The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. Over\n",
        "695": "      the rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was\n      thrust out an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all\n      seamed and scored with vile passions. Foul with mire, with a\n      bristling beard, and hung with matted hair, it might well have\n      belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows on\n      the hillsides. The light beneath him was reflected in his small,\n      cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the\n      darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps\n      of the hunters.\n",
        "696": "      Something had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have been\n      that Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to\n      give, or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking\n      that all was not well, but I could read his fears upon his wicked\n      face. Any instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the\n      darkness. I sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry did the same.\n",
        "697": "      At the same moment the convict screamed out a curse at us and\n      hurled a rock which splintered up against the boulder which had\n      sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his short, squat, strongly\n      built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run. At the\n      same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds.\n",
        "698": "      We rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man\n      running with great speed down the other side, springing over the\n      stones in his way with the activity of a mountain goat. A lucky\n      long shot of my revolver might have crippled him, but I had\n      brought it only to defend myself if attacked and not to shoot an\n      unarmed man who was running away.\n      We were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but we\n      soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him. We saw him\n",
        "699": "      for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small speck\n      moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a distant\n      hill. We ran and ran until we were completely blown, but the\n      space between us grew ever wider. Finally we stopped and sat\n      panting on two rocks, while we watched him disappearing in the\n      distance.\n",
        "700": "      And it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and\n      unexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning to\n      go home, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low\n      upon the right, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up\n      against the lower curve of its silver disc. There, outlined as\n",
        "701": "      black as an ebony statue on that shining background, I saw the\n      figure of a man upon the tor. Do not think that it was a\n      delusion, Holmes. I assure you that I have never in my life seen\n      anything more clearly. As far as I could judge, the figure was\n",
        "702": "      that of a tall, thin man. He stood with his legs a little\n      separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were\n      brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which\n      lay before him. He might have been the very spirit of that\n      terrible place. It was not the convict. This man was far from the\n",
        "703": "      place where the latter had disappeared. Besides, he was a much\n      taller man. With a cry of surprise I pointed him out to the\n      baronet, but in the instant during which I had turned to grasp\n      his arm the man was gone. There was the sharp pinnacle of granite\n",

There was\n      something subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of\n      expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness of lip\n      which marred its perfect beauty.

At every rise Holmes looked eagerly\n",

So\n      grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant\n      realise that that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a\n      whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which\n      we stooped. Holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again\n",
        "936": "      with an exclamation of horror. The gleam of the match which he\n      struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool\n      which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim.

We caught the one\n      clear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered and went out,\n      even as the hope had gone out of our souls. Holmes groaned, and\n      his face glimmered white through the darkness.\n",
        "938": "      \u201cThe brute! The brute!\u201d I cried with clenched hands. \u201cOh Holmes,\n      I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.\u201d\n      \u201cI am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case\n",

Then\n      as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which\n      our poor friend had fallen, and from the summit we gazed out over\n      the shadowy moor, half silver and half gloom. Far away, miles\n",

How he pulled\n      himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing\n      shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his\n      plot. I told you in London, Watson, and I tell you now again,\n      that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel.\u201d\n",
        "978": "      \u201cI am sorry that he has seen you.\u201d\n      \u201cAnd so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.\u201d\n      \u201cWhat effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he\n      knows you are here?\u201d\n",
        "979": "      \u201cIt may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to\n      desperate measures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be\n      too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has\n      completely deceived us.\u201d\n      \u201cWhy should we not arrest him at once?\u201d\n",
        "980": "      \u201cMy dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your\n      instinct is always to do something energetic. But supposing, for\n      argument\u2019s sake, that we had him arrested tonight, what on earth\n      the better off should we be for that? We could prove nothing\n",
        "981": "      against him. There\u2019s the devilish cunning of it! If he were\n      acting through a human agent we could get some evidence, but if\n      we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not\n      help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.\u201d\n      \u201cSurely we have a case.\u201d\n",
        "982": "      \u201cNot a shadow of one\u2014only surmise and conjecture. We should be\n      laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such\n      evidence.\u201d\n      \u201cThere is Sir Charles\u2019s death.\u201d\n",

You and I know that he died\n      of sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how\n      are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are\n      there of a hound? Where are the marks of its fangs? Of course we\n",
        "984": "      know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles\n      was dead before ever the brute overtook him. But we have to prove\n      all this, and we are not in a position to do it.\u201d\n      \u201cWell, then, tonight?\u201d\n",
        "985": "      \u201cWe are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct\n      connection between the hound and the man\u2019s death. We never saw\n      the hound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was\n",

        "987": "      \u201cAnd how do you propose to do so?\u201d\n      \u201cI have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when\n      the position of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own\n",

        "989": "      \u201cAre you coming up?\u201d\n      \u201cYes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word,\n      Watson. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him think that\n",
        "990": "      Selden\u2019s death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will\n      have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo\n      tomorrow, when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright,\n      to dine with these people.\u201d\n      \u201cAnd so am I.\u201d\n",
        "991": "      \u201cThen you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be\n      easily arranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think\n      that we are both ready for our suppers.\u201d\n",

        "1010": "      \u201cThat is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the\n      West Indies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is\n      Sir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the\n      House of Commons under Pitt.\u201d\n      \u201cAnd this Cavalier opposite to me\u2014the one with the black velvet\n      and the lace?\u201d\n",

        "1012": "      \u201cDear me!\u201d said Holmes, \u201che seems a quiet, meek-mannered man\n      enough, but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his\n      eyes. I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person.\u201d\n      \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the\n      date, 1647, are on the back of the canvas.\u201d\n",
        "1013": "      Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer\n      seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were\n      continually fixed upon it during supper. It was not until later,\n      when Sir Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow\n      the trend of his thoughts. He led me back into the\n      banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he held it\n      up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.\n",
        "1014": "      \u201cDo you see anything there?\u201d\n      I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the\n      white lace collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed\n      between them. It was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim,\n      hard, and stern, with a firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly\n      intolerant eye.\n",
        "1015": "      \u201cIs it like anyone you know?\u201d\n      \u201cThere is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.\u201d\n      \u201cJust a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!\u201d He stood upon\n",

        "1017": "      \u201cHa, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces\n      and not their trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal\n      investigator that he should see through a disguise.\u201d\n",
        "1018": "      \u201cBut this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.\u201d\n      \u201cYes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears\n      to be both physical and spiritual.

        "1022": "      \u201cYes, we should have a full day today,\u201d he remarked, and he\n      rubbed his hands with the joy of action. \u201cThe nets are all in\n      place, and the drag is about to begin.

From his knowledge of our rooms\n      and of my appearance, as well as from his general conduct, I am\n      inclined to think that Stapleton\u2019s career of crime has been by no\n      means limited to this single Baskerville affair. It is suggestive\n",
        "1188": "      that during the last three years there have been four\n      considerable burglaries in the west country, for none of which\n      was any criminal ever arrested.

From that\n      moment he understood that I had taken over the case in London,\n      and that therefore there was no chance for him there.

        "1191": "      \u201cI have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly\n      of importance. There can be no question that Stapleton had a\n      confidant, though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in\n      his power by sharing all his plans with him. There was an old\n      manservant at Merripit House, whose name was Anthony. His\n",
        "1192": "      connection with the Stapletons can be traced for several years,\n      as far back as the school-mastering days, so that he must have\n      been aware that his master and mistress were really husband and\n      wife. This man has disappeared and has escaped from the country.\n      It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England,\n      while Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries.\n      The man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but\n",

It is very probable, therefore, that in the absence of his\n      master it was he who cared for the hound, though he may never\n      have known the purpose for which the beast was used.\n",
        "1194": "      \u201cThe Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they were\n      soon followed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to how I\n      stood myself at that time. It may possibly recur to your memory\n      that when I examined the paper upon which the printed words were\n      fastened I made a close inspection for the water-mark. In doing\n",

The scent suggested the presence of a lady,\n      and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons.\n",
        "1196": "      Thus I had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the\n      criminal before ever we went to the west country.\n      \u201cIt was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that\n      I could not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly\n      on his guard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included,\n",
        "1197": "      and I came down secretly when I was supposed to be in London. My\n      hardships were not so great as you imagined, though such trifling\n      details must never interfere with the investigation of a case. I\n      stayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut\n      upon the moor when it was necessary to be near the scene of\n      action. Cartwright had come down with me, and in his disguise as\n",
        "1198": "      a country boy he was of great assistance to me. I was dependent\n      upon him for food and clean linen. When I was watching Stapleton,\n      Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I was able to\n      keep my hand upon all the strings.\n",
        "1199": "      \u201cI have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly,\n      being forwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey.\n      They were of great service to me, and especially that one\n      incidentally truthful piece of biography of Stapleton\u2019s. I was\n      able to establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew\n      at last exactly how I stood. The case had been considerably\n",

        "1201": "      that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate convict\n      did not help us much in proving murder against our man. There\n      seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red-handed, and to\n      do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and apparently unprotected,\n      as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a severe shock to our\n      client we succeeded in completing our case and driving Stapleton\n      to his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been exposed to\n",
        "1202": "      this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case,\n      but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing\n      spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog\n      which enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice. We\n      succeeded in our object at a cost which both the specialist and\n      Dr. Mortimer assure me will be a temporary one. A long journey\n      may enable our friend to recover not only from his shattered\n      nerves but also from his wounded feelings. His love for the lady\n",
        "1203": "      was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part of all this\n      black business was that he should have been deceived by her.\n      \u201cIt only remains to indicate the part which she had played\n      throughout. There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an\n      influence over her which may have been love or may have been\n      fear, or very possibly both, since they are by no means\n      incompatible emotions. It was, at least, absolutely effective. At\n",

She was ready to warn Sir Henry\n      so far as she could without implicating her husband, and again\n      and again she tried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to have\n      been capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying\n      court to the lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still\n      he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which\n      revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained manner so\n      cleverly concealed.

She had learned something of the death of\n      the convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the\n      outhouse on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner. She\n",
        "1206": "      taxed her husband with his intended crime, and a furious scene\n      followed in which he showed her for the first time that she had a\n      rival in his love. Her fidelity turned in an instant to bitter\n      hatred, and he saw that she would betray him. He tied her up,\n      therefore, that she might have no chance of warning Sir Henry,\n      and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put down\n      the baronet\u2019s death to the curse of his family, as they certainly\n      would do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished\n      fact and to keep silent upon what she knew.
