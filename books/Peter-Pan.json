        "9": "she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran\nwith it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather\ndelightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, \u201cOh,\nwhy can\u2019t you remain like this for ever!\u201d This was all that passed\n",
        "10": "between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must\ngrow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the\nend.\nOf course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother was the\nchief one. She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet\n",
        "11": "mocking mouth. Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within\nthe other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover\nthere is always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on\nit that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly\nconspicuous in the right-hand corner.\nThe way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been\n",
        "12": "boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her,\nand they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who\ntook a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her,\nexcept the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and\n",
        "13": "in time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could\nhave got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a\npassion, slamming the door.\nMr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him\n",
        "14": "but respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks\nand shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know,\nand he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that\nwould have made any woman respect him.\n",
        "15": "Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books\nperfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a\nBrussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped\nout, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces.\nShe drew them when she should have been totting up. They were Mrs.\n",

        "17": "frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the\nedge of Mrs. Darling\u2019s bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses,\nwhile she looked at him imploringly. She wanted to risk it, come what\nmight, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece\nof paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at\nthe beginning again.\n",
        "18": "\u201cNow don\u2019t interrupt,\u201d he would beg of her.\n\u201cI have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can\ncut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and\nsix, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five\nnaught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven\u2014who is that\nmoving?\u2014eight nine seven, dot and carry seven\u2014don\u2019t speak, my own\u2014and\nthe pound you lent to that man who came to the door\u2014quiet, child\u2014dot\nand carry child\u2014there, you\u2019ve done it!\u2014did I say nine nine seven? yes,\n",
        "19": "I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on\nnine nine seven?\u201d\n\u201cOf course we can, George,\u201d she cried. But she was prejudiced in\nWendy\u2019s favour, and he was really the grander character of the two.\n",
        "20": "\u201cRemember mumps,\u201d he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went\nagain. \u201cMumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay it\nwill be more like thirty shillings\u2014don\u2019t speak\u2014measles one five, German\nmeasles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six\u2014don\u2019t waggle your\nfinger\u2014whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings\u201d\u2014and so on it went, and it\nadded up differently each time; but at last Wendy just got through,\nwith mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated\nas one.\nThere was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a\nnarrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the\nthree of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom\u2019s Kindergarten school,\naccompanied by their nurse.\n",
        "21": "Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a\npassion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had\na nurse. As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children\ndrank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had\nbelonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. She\n",
        "22": "had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had\nbecome acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most\nof her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by\ncareless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of\nto their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How\nthorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one\nof her charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the\nnursery. She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have\n",
        "23": "no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat. She\nbelieved to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf,\nand made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs,\nand so on. It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the\nchildren to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well\nbehaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed. On John\u2019s\n",
        "24": "footer days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried\nan umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the\nbasement of Miss Fulsom\u2019s school where the nurses wait. They sat on\nforms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference.\n",
        "25": "They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to\nthemselves, and she despised their light talk. She resented visits to\nthe nursery from Mrs. Darling\u2019s friends, but if they did come she first\nwhipped off Michael\u2019s pinafore and put him into the one with blue\nbraiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John\u2019s hair.\n",
        "26": "No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr.\nDarling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the\nneighbours talked.\nHe had his position in the city to consider.\n",
        "27": "Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that\nshe did not admire him. \u201cI know she admires you tremendously, George,\u201d\nMrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children\n",
        "28": "to be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the\nonly other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget\nshe looked in her long skirt and maid\u2019s cap, though she had sworn, when\nengaged, that she would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps!\n",
        "29": "And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that\nall you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at\nher you might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family\nuntil the coming of Peter Pan.\n",
        "30": "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her\nchildren\u2019s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after\nher children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things\nstraight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many\narticles that have wandered during the day. If you could keep awake\n",
        "31": "(but of course you can\u2019t) you would see your own mother doing this, and\nyou would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like\ntidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering\nhumorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had\npicked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet,\npressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and\nhurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the\n",

There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a\n",
        "33": "card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is\nalways more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here\nand there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and\nsavages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves\nthrough which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a\nhut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked\nnose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first\nday at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,\nhangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting\ninto braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth\nyourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they\nare another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing,\nespecially as nothing will stand still.\nOf course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John\u2019s, for instance, had a\n",
        "34": "lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while\nMichael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over\nit. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a\nwigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no\nfriends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by\nits parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance,\nand if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have\neach other\u2019s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play\n",

We too have been there; we can\nstill hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.\nOf all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most\ncompact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances\nbetween one adventure and another, but nicely crammed.

That is why there are night-lights.\nOccasionally in her travels through her children\u2019s minds Mrs. Darling\nfound things she could not understand, and of these quite the most\nperplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was\n",
        "37": "here and there in John and Michael\u2019s minds, while Wendy\u2019s began to be\nscrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than\nany of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had\nan oddly cocky appearance.\n",
        "38": "\u201cYes, he is rather cocky,\u201d Wendy admitted with regret. Her mother had\nbeen questioning her.\n\u201cBut who is he, my pet?\u201d\n",
        "39": "\u201cHe is Peter Pan, you know, mother.\u201d\nAt first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her\nchildhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the\nfairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died\n",
        "40": "he went part of the way with them, so that they should not be\nfrightened. She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was\nmarried and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such\nperson.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d she said to Wendy, \u201che would be grown up by this time.\u201d\n",
        "41": "\u201cOh no, he isn\u2019t grown up,\u201d Wendy assured her confidently, \u201cand he is\njust my size.\u201d She meant that he was her size in both mind and body;\nshe didn\u2019t know how she knew, she just knew it.\nMrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. \u201cMark my\n",
        "42": "words,\u201d he said, \u201cit is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their\nheads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it\nwill blow over.\u201d\nBut it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs.\n",

It was in this casual way that Wendy\n",
        "44": "one morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had\nbeen found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when\nthe children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when\nWendy said with a tolerant smile:\n\u201cI do believe it is that Peter again!\u201d\n",
        "45": "\u201cWhatever do you mean, Wendy?\u201d\n\u201cIt is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,\u201d Wendy said, sighing.\nShe was a tidy child.\n",
        "46": "She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter\nsometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her\nbed and played on his pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so\nshe didn\u2019t know how she knew, she just knew.\n\u201cWhat nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house\n",
        "47": "without knocking.\u201d\n\u201cI think he comes in by the window,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMy love, it is three floors up.\u201d\n",
        "48": "\u201cWere not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?\u201d\nIt was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.\nMrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural\n",
        "49": "to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.\n\u201cMy child,\u201d the mother cried, \u201cwhy did you not tell me of this before?\u201d\n\u201cI forgot,\u201d said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her\n",
        "50": "breakfast.\nOh, surely she must have been dreaming.\nBut, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined\n",
        "51": "them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they\ndid not come from any tree that grew in England. She crawled about the\nfloor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot. She\nrattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls. She let down a\n",
        "52": "tape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty\nfeet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.\nCertainly Wendy had been dreaming.\nBut Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the\nnight on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be\nsaid to have begun.\n",
        "53": "On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It\nhappened to be Nana\u2019s evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and\nsung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away\ninto the land of sleep.\n",
        "54": "All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and\nsat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.\nIt was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into\nshirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three\nnight-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling\u2019s lap. Then\n",
        "55": "her head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of\nthem, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the\nfire. There should have been a fourth night-light.\n",
        "56": "While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come\ntoo near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not\nalarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many\nwomen who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of\n",
        "57": "some mothers also. But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures\nthe Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through\nthe gap.\nThe dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was\ndreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the\nfloor. He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist,\n",
        "58": "which darted about the room like a living thing and I think it must\nhave been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.\nShe started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at\nonce that he was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we\nshould have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling\u2019s kiss. He was a\n",
        "59": "lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of\ntrees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his\nfirst teeth. When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed the little\npearls at her.\nChapter II.\n",
        "60": "THE SHADOW\nMrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened,\nand Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang\nat the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling\n",
        "61": "screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed,\nand she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it\nwas not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see\nnothing but what she thought was a shooting star.\nShe returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her\nmouth, which proved to be the boy\u2019s shadow. As he leapt at the window\nNana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had\nnot had time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.\n",
        "62": "You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was\nquite the ordinary kind.\nNana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow.\n",
        "63": "She hung it out at the window, meaning \u201cHe is sure to come back for it;\nlet us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the\nchildren.\u201d\nBut unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the\nwindow, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the\nhouse. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up\n",
        "64": "winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his\nhead to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him;\nbesides, she knew exactly what he would say: \u201cIt all comes of having a\ndog for a nurse.\u201d\nShe decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a\ndrawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah\nme!\n",
        "65": "The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten\nFriday. Of course it was a Friday.\n\u201cI ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,\u201d she used to say\nafterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of\nher, holding her hand.\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Mr. Darling always said, \u201cI am responsible for it all. I,\n",
        "66": "George Darling, did it. _Mea culpa, mea culpa_.\u201d He had had a classical\neducation.\nThey sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every\ndetail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other\nside like the faces on a bad coinage.\n",
        "67": "\u201cIf only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,\u201d Mrs.\nDarling said.\n\u201cIf only I had not poured my medicine into Nana\u2019s bowl,\u201d said Mr.\n",

        "70": "Nana\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cThat fiend!\u201d Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana\u2019s bark was the echo of\nit, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the\n",

        "72": "\u201cI won\u2019t go to bed,\u201d he had shouted, like one who still believed that\nhe had the last word on the subject, \u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t.

It was not\nreally a light; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but\nwhen it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer\nthan your hand, but still growing.

        "399": "Immediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing:\n\u201cI wish I had a pretty house,\n    The littlest ever seen,\nWith funny little red walls\n    And roof of mossy green.\u201d\nThey gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the\nbranches they had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground\nwas carpeted with moss. As they rattled up the little house they broke\ninto song themselves:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built the little walls and roof\n    And made a lovely door,\nSo tell us, mother Wendy,\n    What are you wanting more?\u201d\n",
        "400": "To this she answered greedily:\n\u201cOh, really next I think I\u2019ll have\n    Gay windows all about,\nWith roses peeping in, you know,\n    And babies peeping out.\u201d\nWith a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves\nwere the blinds. But roses\u2014?\n\u201cRoses,\u201d cried Peter sternly.\n",
        "401": "Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls.\nBabies?\nTo prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made the roses peeping out,\n    The babes are at the door,\nWe cannot make ourselves, you know,\n    \u2019Cos we\u2019ve been made before.\u201d\n",
        "402": "Peter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his\nown. The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy\nwithin, though, of course, they could no longer see her. Peter strode\nup and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing escaped his eagle\n",
        "403": "eyes. Just when it seemed absolutely finished:\n\u201cThere\u2019s no knocker on the door,\u201d he said.\nThey were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe, and it\nmade an excellent knocker.\n",
        "404": "Absolutely finished now, they thought.\nNot of bit of it. \u201cThere\u2019s no chimney,\u201d Peter said; \u201cwe must have a\nchimney.\u201d\n",
        "405": "\u201cIt certainly does need a chimney,\u201d said John importantly. This gave\nPeter an idea. He snatched the hat off John\u2019s head, knocked out the\nbottom, and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so pleased to\n",

        "408": "What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a\nlady, what would she be like?\nThe door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off\n",

        "413": "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Peter, as if he were the only person\npresent who knew all about it, though he was really the one who knew\nleast. \u201cWhat we need is just a nice motherly person.\u201d\n\u201cOh dear!\u201d Wendy said, \u201cyou see, I feel that is exactly what I am.\u201d\n\u201cIt is, it is,\u201d they all cried; \u201cwe saw it at once.\u201d\n",
        "414": "\u201cVery well,\u201d she said, \u201cI will do my best. Come inside at once, you\nnaughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you to\nbed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.\u201d\n",
        "415": "In they went; I don\u2019t know how there was room for them, but you can\nsqueeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many\njoyous evenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in\nthe great bed in the home under the trees, but she herself slept that\nnight in the little house, and Peter kept watch outside with drawn\nsword, for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves\nwere on the prowl. The little house looked so cosy and safe in the\n",
        "416": "darkness, with a bright light showing through its blinds, and the\nchimney smoking beautifully, and Peter standing on guard. After a time\nhe fell asleep, and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on\ntheir way home from an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the\nfairy path at night they would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked\nPeter\u2019s nose and passed on.\n",
        "417": "Chapter VII.\nTHE HOME UNDER THE GROUND\nOne of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and\nJohn and Michael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at\nthe boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was\nignorance, for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up\nand down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size. Once you\n",
        "418": "fitted, you drew in your breath at the top, and down you went at\nexactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out\nalternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the\naction you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and\nnothing can be more graceful.\nBut you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as\ncarefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the\nclothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree.\n",
        "419": "Usually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments\nor too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only\navailable tree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to you, and\nafter that you fit. Once you fit, great care must be taken to go on\nfitting, and this, as Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps a\nwhole family in perfect condition.\nWendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to\nbe altered a little.\n",
        "420": "After a few days\u2019 practice they could go up and down as gaily as\nbuckets in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under\nthe ground; especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all\nhouses should do, with a floor in which you could dig if you wanted to\ngo fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming\ncolour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in\n",
        "421": "the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through,\nlevel with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two feet high,\nand then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table;\nas soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus\nthere was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was\nin almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across\nthis Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended\nher washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down\n",
        "422": "at 6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in\nit, except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict\nrule against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned\nat once. Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have a baby,\nand he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the short and\nlong of it is that he was hung up in a basket.\n",
        "423": "It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made\nof an underground house in the same circumstances. But there was one\nrecess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private\napartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut off from the rest of the\nhouse by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious, always\nkept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman, however large, could\n",

Really there were whole\n",

The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the\npot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she\nhad to keep watching that it came aboil just the same. You never\nexactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe,\nit all depended upon Peter\u2019s whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was\npart of a game, but he could not stodge just to feel stodgy, which is\nwhat most children like better than anything else; the next best thing\nbeing to talk about it. Make-believe was so real to him that during a\n",

Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for\n",

        "429": "You remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she\nhad come to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into\neach other\u2019s arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.\nAs time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had\nleft behind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite\n",
        "430": "impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is\ncalculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them\nthan on the mainland. But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry\nabout her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they\nwould always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave\nher complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at times was that John\nremembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while\nMichael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.\n",
        "431": "These things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she\ntried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination\npapers on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school.\nThe other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on\njoining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table,\nwriting and thinking hard about the questions she had written on\nanother slate and passed round.

Of course the only boy who\nreplied to every question was Slightly, and no one could have been more\nhopeful of coming out first, but his answers were perfectly ridiculous,\nand he really came out last: a melancholy thing.\n",
        "434": "Peter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers except\nWendy, and for another he was the only boy on the island who could\nneither write nor spell; not the smallest word. He was above all that\nsort of thing.\n",

It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the\nsort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting\non stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for\nwalks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly.

When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon\nshe might see them by the score, especially on Marooners\u2019 Rock, where\nthey loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite\nirritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within\na yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her\nwith their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.\n",

        "924": "\u201cI forget them after I kill them,\u201d he replied carelessly.\nWhen she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to\nsee her he said, \u201cWho is Tinker Bell?\u201d\n\u201cO Peter,\u201d she said, shocked; but even when she explained he could not\nremember.\n",
        "925": "\u201cThere are such a lot of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect she is no more.\u201d\nI expect he was right, for fairies don\u2019t live long, but they are so\nlittle that a short time seems a good while to them.\nWendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to\nPeter; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was\n",
        "926": "exactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning\nin the little house on the tree tops.\nNext year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock because\nthe old one simply would not meet; but he never came.\n",
        "927": "\u201cPerhaps he is ill,\u201d Michael said.\n\u201cYou know he is never ill.\u201d\nMichael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, \u201cPerhaps there\nis no such person, Wendy!\u201d and then Wendy would have cried if Michael\n",
        "928": "had not been crying.\nPeter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he\nnever knew he had missed a year.\nThat was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer\n",
        "929": "she tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was\nuntrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years\ncame and went without bringing the careless boy; and when they met\nagain Wendy was a married woman, and Peter was no more to her than a\nlittle dust in the box in which she had kept her toys. Wendy was grown\nup. You need not be sorry for her. She was one of the kind that likes\n",

        "933": "Years rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be\nwritten in ink but in a golden splash.\nShe was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from\nthe moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions.\n",
        "934": "When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan.\nShe loved to hear of Peter, and Wendy told her all she could remember\nin the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. It\nwas Jane\u2019s nursery now, for her father had bought it at the three per\ncents from Wendy\u2019s father, who was no longer fond of stairs. Mrs.\n",
        "935": "Darling was now dead and forgotten.\nThere were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane\u2019s and her nurse\u2019s;\nand there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She died of old\nage, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being\nvery firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children\nexcept herself.\n",
        "936": "Once a week Jane\u2019s nurse had her evening off; and then it was Wendy\u2019s\npart to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It was Jane\u2019s\ninvention to raise the sheet over her mother\u2019s head and her own, thus\nmaking a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:\n\u201cWhat do we see now?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I see anything to-night,\u201d says Wendy, with a feeling\nthat if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.\n",

        "943": "\u201cI do believe it is,\u201d says Jane. \u201cGo on.\u201d\nThey are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter\nflew in looking for his shadow.\n\u201cThe foolish fellow,\u201d says Wendy, \u201ctried to stick it on with soap, and\nwhen he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for\nhim.\u201d\n",
        "944": "\u201cYou have missed a bit,\u201d interrupts Jane, who now knows the story\nbetter than her mother. \u201cWhen you saw him sitting on the floor crying,\nwhat did you say?\u201d\n\u201cI sat up in bed and I said, \u2018Boy, why are you crying?\u2019\u201d\n",
        "945": "\u201cYes, that was it,\u201d says Jane, with a big breath.\n\u201cAnd then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the\npirates and the redskins and the mermaids\u2019 lagoon, and the home under\nthe ground, and the little house.\u201d\n\u201cYes! which did you like best of all?\u201d\n",
        "946": "\u201cI think I liked the home under the ground best of all.\u201d\n\u201cYes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?\u201d\n\u201cThe last thing he ever said to me was, \u2018Just always be waiting for me,\nand then some night you will hear me crowing.\u2019\u201d\n",
        "947": "\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cBut, alas, he forgot all about me,\u201d Wendy said it with a smile. She\nwas as grown up as that.\n",
        "948": "\u201cWhat did his crow sound like?\u201d Jane asked one evening.\n\u201cIt was like this,\u201d Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter\u2019s crow.\n\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Jane said gravely, \u201cit was like this;\u201d and she did it\never so much better than her mother.\n",
        "949": "Wendy was a little startled. \u201cMy darling, how can you know?\u201d\n\u201cI often hear it when I am sleeping,\u201d Jane said.\n\u201cAh yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only\none who heard it awake.\u201d\n",
        "950": "\u201cLucky you,\u201d said Jane.\nAnd then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and\nthe story had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her\nbed. Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to\n",

        "952": "He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not\ndaring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.\n\u201cHullo, Wendy,\u201d he said, not noticing any difference, for he was\nthinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might\nhave been the nightgown in which he had seen her first.\n",
        "953": "\u201cHullo, Peter,\u201d she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as\npossible. Something inside her was crying \u201cWoman, Woman, let go of me.\u201d\n\u201cHullo, where is John?\u201d he asked, suddenly missing the third bed.\n\u201cJohn is not here now,\u201d she gasped.\n",
        "954": "\u201cIs Michael asleep?\u201d he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as\nwell as to Peter.\n\u201cThat is not Michael,\u201d she said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on\nher.\n",
        "955": "Peter looked. \u201cHullo, is it a new one?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cBoy or girl?\u201d\n",

        "962": "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he cried again.\nShe had to tell him.\n\u201cI am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up long\n",

She was only a woman\nnow, and she ran out of the room to try to think.\n",
