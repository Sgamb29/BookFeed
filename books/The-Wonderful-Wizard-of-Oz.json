Their\nhouse was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon\nmany miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one\n",
        "13": "room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for\nthe dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry\nand Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in\nanother corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar\u2014except a\nsmall hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family\ncould go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to\ncrush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the\n",

Not a tree nor a\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of\nthe sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a\n",
        "15": "gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had\nbeen painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it\naway, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\n",
        "16": "When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun\nand wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes\nand left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and\nlips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled\n",
        "17": "now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had\nbeen so startled by the child\u2019s laughter that she would scream and\npress her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy\u2019s merry voice reached\nher ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she\ncould find anything to laugh at.\nUncle Henry never laughed.

When she\nwas halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind,\nand the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down\nsuddenly upon the floor.\n",
        "25": "Then a strange thing happened.\nThe house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the\nair. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.\nThe north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the\nexact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is\n",
        "26": "generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of\nthe house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top\nof the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles\naway as easily as you could carry a feather.\nIt was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy\nfound she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around,\nand one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were\nbeing rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.\n",
        "27": "Toto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there,\nbarking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to\nsee what would happen.\nOnce Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first\nthe little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his\n",
        "28": "ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air\nwas keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole,\ncaught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward\nclosing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen.\nHour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright;\nbut she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about\nher that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would\n",
        "29": "be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed\nand nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to\nwait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last she crawled\nover the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto\nfollowed and lay down beside her.\nIn spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind,\nDorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.\n",
        "30": "Chapter II\nThe Council with the Munchkins\nShe was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had\nnot been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the\njar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto\nput his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat\nup and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the\nbright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She\n",
        "31": "sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.\nThe little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes\ngrowing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.\nThe cyclone had set the house down very gently\u2014for a cyclone\u2014in the\nmidst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of\n",
        "32": "greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious\nfruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with\nrare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes.\nA little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between\ngreen banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl\nwho had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.\n",
        "33": "While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,\nshe noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had\never seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been\nused to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about\nas tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although\nthey were, so far as looks go, many years older.\n",
        "34": "Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore\nround hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with\nlittle bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The\nhats of the men were blue; the little woman\u2019s hat was white, and she\nwore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were\n",
        "35": "sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men\nwere dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore\nwell-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men,\nDorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had\nbeards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was\n",
        "36": "covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather\nstiffly.\nWhen these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the\ndoorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to\ncome farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low\nbow and said, in a sweet voice:\n\u201cYou are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.\n",
        "37": "We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the\nEast, and for setting our people free from bondage.\u201d\nDorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little\nwoman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had\nkilled the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless\n",
        "38": "little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;\nand she had never killed anything in all her life.\nBut the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,\nwith hesitation, \u201cYou are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I\nhave not killed anything.\u201d\n",
        "39": "\u201cYour house did, anyway,\u201d replied the little old woman, with a laugh,\n\u201cand that is the same thing. See!\u201d she continued, pointing to the\ncorner of the house. \u201cThere are her two feet, still sticking out from\nunder a block of wood.\u201d\n",
        "40": "Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just\nunder the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were\nsticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.\n\u201cOh, dear! Oh, dear!\u201d cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in\n",
        "41": "dismay. \u201cThe house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?\u201d\n\u201cThere is nothing to be done,\u201d said the little woman calmly.\n\u201cBut who was she?\u201d asked Dorothy.\n",
        "42": "\u201cShe was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,\u201d answered the little\nwoman. \u201cShe has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,\nmaking them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and\nare grateful to you for the favor.\u201d\n",
        "43": "\u201cWho are the Munchkins?\u201d inquired Dorothy.\n\u201cThey are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked\nWitch ruled.\u201d\n\u201cAre you a Munchkin?\u201d asked Dorothy.\n",
        "44": "\u201cNo, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.\nWhen they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift\nmessenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.\u201d\n\u201cOh, gracious!\u201d cried Dorothy. \u201cAre you a real witch?\u201d\n",
        "45": "\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d answered the little woman. \u201cBut I am a good witch, and\nthe people love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who\nruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.\u201d\n",
        "46": "\u201cBut I thought all witches were wicked,\u201d said the girl, who was half\nfrightened at facing a real witch. \u201cOh, no, that is a great mistake.\nThere were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them,\nthose who live in the North and the South, are good witches. I know\nthis is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken.\n",
        "47": "Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches;\nbut now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch\nin all the Land of Oz\u2014the one who lives in the West.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Dorothy, after a moment\u2019s thought, \u201cAunt Em has told me\nthat the witches were all dead\u2014years and years ago.\u201d\n\u201cWho is Aunt Em?\u201d inquired the little old woman.\n",
        "48": "\u201cShe is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.\u201d\nThe Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed\nand her eyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said, \u201cI do not\nknow where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned\nbefore. But tell me, is it a civilized country?\u201d\n",
        "49": "\u201cOh, yes,\u201d replied Dorothy.\n\u201cThen that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there\nare no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But,\n",
        "50": "you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off\nfrom all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and\nwizards amongst us.\u201d\n\u201cWho are the wizards?\u201d asked Dorothy.\n",
        "51": "\u201cOz himself is the Great Wizard,\u201d answered the Witch, sinking her voice\nto a whisper. \u201cHe is more powerful than all the rest of us together. He\nlives in the City of Emeralds.\u201d\nDorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,\nwho had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the\ncorner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.\n",
        "52": "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to\nlaugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing\nwas left but the silver shoes.\n",
        "53": "\u201cShe was so old,\u201d explained the Witch of the North, \u201cthat she dried up\nquickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are\nyours, and you shall have them to wear.\u201d She reached down and picked up\nthe shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to\nDorothy.\n",
        "54": "\u201cThe Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,\u201d said one of\nthe Munchkins, \u201cand there is some charm connected with them; but what\nit is we never knew.\u201d\nDorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table.\nThen she came out again to the Munchkins and said:\n\u201cI am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will\nworry about me. Can you help me find my way?\u201d\n",
        "55": "The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at\nDorothy, and then shook their heads.\n\u201cAt the East, not far from here,\u201d said one, \u201cthere is a great desert,\nand none could live to cross it.\u201d\n\u201cIt is the same at the South,\u201d said another, \u201cfor I have been there and\nseen it. The South is the country of the Quadlings.\u201d\n",
        "56": "\u201cI am told,\u201d said the third man, \u201cthat it is the same at the West. And\nthat country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of\nthe West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.\u201d\n\u201cThe North is my home,\u201d said the old lady, \u201cand at its edge is the same\ngreat desert that surrounds this Land of Oz. I\u2019m afraid, my dear, you\n",
        "57": "will have to live with us.\u201d\nDorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these\nstrange people. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins,\nfor they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep\nalso. As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced\n",
        "58": "the point on the end of her nose, while she counted \u201cOne, two, three\u201d\nin a solemn voice. At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was\nwritten in big, white chalk marks:\n\u201cLET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS\u201d\nThe little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the\nwords on it, asked, \u201cIs your name Dorothy, my dear?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.\n",
        "59": "\u201cThen you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is this city?\u201d asked Dorothy.\n\u201cIt is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the\nGreat Wizard I told you of.\u201d\n",
        "60": "\u201cIs he a good man?\u201d inquired the girl anxiously.\n\u201cHe is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I\nhave never seen him.\u201d\n",
        "61": "\u201cHow can I get there?\u201d asked Dorothy.\n\u201cYou must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is\nsometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use\n",
        "62": "all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.\u201d\n\u201cWon\u2019t you go with me?\u201d pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon\nthe little old woman as her only friend.\n",
        "63": "\u201cNo, I cannot do that,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut I will give you my kiss, and\nno one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of\nthe North.\u201d\nShe came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where\nher lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy\nfound out soon after.\n",
        "64": "\u201cThe road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,\u201d said the\nWitch, \u201cso you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of\nhim, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.\u201d\nThe three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey,\nafter which they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy\n",
        "65": "a friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and\nstraightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who\nbarked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been\nafraid even to growl while she stood by.\nBut Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear\nin just that way, and was not surprised in the least.\nChapter III\nHow Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow\nWhen Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry. So she went to\n",
        "66": "the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter.\nShe gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it\ndown to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water.\nToto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting\nthere. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging\n",
        "67": "from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what\nshe wanted to help out her breakfast.\nThen she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to\na good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for\nthe journey to the City of Emeralds.\nDorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was\nhanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white\n",
        "68": "and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,\nit was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed\nherself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head.\nShe took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard,\nlaying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and\n",
        "69": "noticed how old and worn her shoes were.\n\u201cThey surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,\u201d she said. And\nToto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his\ntail to show he knew what she meant.\n",
        "70": "At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had\nbelonged to the Witch of the East.\n\u201cI wonder if they will fit me,\u201d she said to Toto. \u201cThey would be just\nthe thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.\u201d\n",
        "71": "She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which\nfitted her as well as if they had been made for her.\nFinally she picked up her basket.\n\u201cCome along, Toto,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will go to the Emerald City and ask\n",
        "72": "the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.\u201d\nShe closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket\nof her dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she\nstarted on her journey.\n",
        "73": "There were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find\nthe one paved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking\nbriskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on\nthe hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang\nsweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a\nlittle girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own\ncountry and set down in the midst of a strange land.\n",
        "74": "She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country\nwas about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted\na dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and\nvegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and\nable to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and\n",
        "75": "the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for\neveryone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and\nsetting them free from bondage. The houses of the Munchkins were\nodd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof.\nAll were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the\nfavorite color.\n",
        "76": "Toward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to\nwonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather\nlarger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women\nwere dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and\nthe people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was\nloaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other\ngood things to eat.\n",
        "77": "The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to\npass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest\nMunchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to\ncelebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.\nDorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin\nhimself, whose name was Boq. Then she sat upon a settee and watched the\npeople dance.\n",
        "78": "When Boq saw her silver shoes he said, \u201cYou must be a great sorceress.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked the girl.\n\u201cBecause you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.\n",
        "79": "Besides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses\nwear white.\u201d\n\u201cMy dress is blue and white checked,\u201d said Dorothy, smoothing out the\nwrinkles in it.\n\u201cIt is kind of you to wear that,\u201d said Boq. \u201cBlue is the color of the\n",

        "89": "do?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not feeling well,\u201d said the Scarecrow, with a smile, \u201cfor it is\nvery tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you get down?\u201d asked Dorothy.\n",

Brains are the only things worth having\nin this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.\u2019\n\u201cAfter the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try\nhard to get some brains.

        "133": "\u201cDid you groan?\u201d asked Dorothy.\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered the tin man, \u201cI did. I\u2019ve been groaning for more than a\nyear, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.\u201d\n",
        "134": "\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d she inquired softly, for she was moved by the\nsad voice in which the man spoke.\n\u201cGet an oil-can and oil my joints,\u201d he answered. \u201cThey are rusted so\n",
        "135": "badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon\nbe all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.\u201d\nDorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then\nshe returned and asked anxiously, \u201cWhere are your joints?\u201d\n\u201cOil my neck, first,\u201d replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as\n",

        "137": "The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which\nhe leaned against the tree.\n\u201cThis is a great comfort,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been holding that axe in\nthe air ever since I rusted, and I\u2019m glad to be able to put it down at\nlast.

        "218": "\u201cAnd I should never get back to Kansas,\u201d said Dorothy.\n\u201cWe must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,\u201d the Scarecrow\ncontinued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in\nthe mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out\nagain\u2014or let go\u2014the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was\nleft clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.\n",
        "219": "\u201cGood-bye!\u201d he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave\nhim. Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered\nthat he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy\u2019s apron.\n",
        "220": "Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.\n\u201cI am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,\u201d he thought. \u201cThen,\nI was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare\nthe crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow\n",
        "221": "stuck on a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never\nhave any brains, after all!\u201d\nDown the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far\nbehind. Then the Lion said:\n",
        "222": "\u201cSomething must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore and\npull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my\ntail.\u201d\nSo he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of\nhis tail. Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the\n",
        "223": "shore. It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they\nwere drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman\u2019s\nlong pole and helped push the raft to the land.\nThey were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped\noff upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had\ncarried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the\nEmerald City.\n",
        "224": "\u201cWhat shall we do now?\u201d asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on\nthe grass to let the sun dry him.\n\u201cWe must get back to the road, in some way,\u201d said Dorothy.\n",
        "225": "\u201cThe best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the\nroad again,\u201d remarked the Lion.\nSo, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they\nstarted along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had\ncarried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit\ntrees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for\nthe poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.\n",
        "226": "They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to\npick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:\n\u201cLook!\u201d\nThen they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon\nhis pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.\n\u201cWhat can we do to save him?\u201d asked Dorothy.\n",
        "227": "The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know.\nSo they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow\nuntil a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the\nwater\u2019s edge.\n\u201cWho are you and where are you going?\u201d asked the Stork.\n",
        "228": "\u201cI am Dorothy,\u201d answered the girl, \u201cand these are my friends, the Tin\nWoodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the road,\u201d said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and\nlooked sharply at the queer party.\n\u201cI know it,\u201d returned Dorothy, \u201cbut we have lost the Scarecrow, and are\nwondering how we shall get him again.\u201d\n",
        "229": "\u201cWhere is he?\u201d asked the Stork.\n\u201cOver there in the river,\u201d answered the little girl.\n\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t so big and heavy I would get him for you,\u201d remarked the\nStork.\n",
        "230": "\u201cHe isn\u2019t heavy a bit,\u201d said Dorothy eagerly, \u201cfor he is stuffed with\nstraw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever\nand ever so much.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll try,\u201d said the Stork, \u201cbut if I find he is too heavy to\ncarry I shall have to drop him in the river again.\u201d\nSo the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to\nwhere the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her\n",
        "231": "great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into\nthe air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin\nWoodman and Toto were sitting.\nWhen the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so\nhappy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they\nwalked along he sang \u201cTol-de-ri-de-oh!\u201d at every step, he felt so gay.\n\u201cI was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,\u201d he said,\n\u201cbut the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find\nthe Stork again and do her some kindness in return.\u201d\n",
        "232": "\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d said the Stork, who was flying along beside them.\n\u201cI always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now, for my\nbabies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald\n",
        "233": "City and that Oz will help you.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air\nand was soon out of sight.\nThey walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored\nbirds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that\nthe ground was carpeted with them. There were big yellow and white and\n",
        "234": "blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies,\nwhich were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cAren\u2019t they beautiful?\u201d the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy\nscent of the bright flowers.\n",
        "235": "\u201cI suppose so,\u201d answered the Scarecrow. \u201cWhen I have brains, I shall\nprobably like them better.\u201d\n\u201cIf I only had a heart, I should love them,\u201d added the Tin Woodman.\n",
        "236": "\u201cI always did like flowers,\u201d said the Lion. \u201cThey seem so helpless and\nfrail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these.\u201d\nThey now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer\nand fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the\nmidst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when\n",
        "237": "there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that\nanyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried\naway from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever. But\nDorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red\nflowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy\nand she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.\nBut the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.\n",
        "238": "\u201cWe must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,\u201d\nhe said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walking until\nDorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and\nshe forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.\n",
        "239": "\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d asked the Tin Woodman.\n\u201cIf we leave her here she will die,\u201d said the Lion. \u201cThe smell of the\nflowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and\n",
        "240": "the dog is asleep already.\u201d\nIt was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not\ntroubled by the scent of the flowers.\n",
        "241": "\u201cRun fast,\u201d said the Scarecrow to the Lion, \u201cand get out of this deadly\nflower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us,\nbut if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.\u201d\nSo the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go.\n",
        "242": "In a moment he was out of sight.\n\u201cLet us make a chair with our hands and carry her,\u201d said the Scarecrow.\nSo they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy\u2019s lap, and then they\nmade a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms\nand carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.\n",
        "243": "On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly\nflowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of\nthe river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast\nasleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge\nbeast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance\nfrom the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in\nbeautiful green fields before them.\n",
        "244": "\u201cWe can do nothing for him,\u201d said the Tin Woodman, sadly; \u201cfor he is\nmuch too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and\nperhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said the Scarecrow. \u201cThe Lion was a very good comrade for\n",
        "245": "one so cowardly. But let us go on.\u201d\nThey carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far\nenough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the\npoison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass\nand waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.\nChapter IX\nThe Queen of the Field Mice\n\u201cWe cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,\u201d remarked the\nScarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, \u201cfor we have come nearly as far\nas the river carried us away.\u201d\n",
        "246": "The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and\nturning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange\nbeast come bounding over the grass toward them. It was, indeed, a great\nyellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something,\nfor its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open,\nshowing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of\nfire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the\nbeast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he\nknew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty,\nharmless creature.\n",
        "247": "So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a\nquick blow that cut the beast\u2019s head clean off from its body, and it\nrolled over at his feet in two pieces.\nThe field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;\nand coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:\n\u201cOh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t speak of it, I beg of you,\u201d replied the Woodman. \u201cI have no\n",

        "249": "\u201cOh, indeed,\u201d said the Woodman, making a bow.\n\u201cTherefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in\nsaving my life,\u201d added the Queen.\nAt that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their\nlittle legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they\nexclaimed:\n\u201cOh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage\n",
        "250": "to escape the great Wildcat?\u201d They all bowed so low to the little Queen\nthat they almost stood upon their heads.\n\u201cThis funny tin man,\u201d she answered, \u201ckilled the Wildcat and saved my\nlife. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest\n",
        "251": "wish.\u201d\n\u201cWe will!\u201d cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they\nscampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and\nseeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped\nright into the middle of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice\n",
        "252": "when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.\nBut the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight,\nwhile he called to the mice, \u201cCome back! Come back! Toto shall not hurt\nyou.\u201d\n",
        "253": "At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a\nclump of grass and asked, in a timid voice, \u201cAre you sure he will not\nbite us?\u201d\n\u201cI will not let him,\u201d said the Woodman; \u201cso do not be afraid.\u201d\nOne by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again,\nalthough he tried to get out of the Woodman\u2019s arms, and would have\nbitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin. Finally one\n",
        "254": "of the biggest mice spoke.\n\u201cIs there anything we can do,\u201d it asked, \u201cto repay you for saving the\nlife of our Queen?\u201d\n\u201cNothing that I know of,\u201d answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, who\nhad been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed\nwith straw, said, quickly, \u201cOh, yes; you can save our friend, the\nCowardly Lion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.\u201d\n",
        "255": "\u201cA Lion!\u201d cried the little Queen. \u201cWhy, he would eat us all up.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d declared the Scarecrow; \u201cthis Lion is a coward.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked the Mouse.\n",
        "256": "\u201cHe says so himself,\u201d answered the Scarecrow, \u201cand he would never hurt\nanyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him I promise\nthat he shall treat you all with kindness.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said the Queen, \u201cwe trust you. But what shall we do?\u201d\n",
        "257": "\u201cAre there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to\nobey you?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes; there are thousands,\u201d she replied.\n\u201cThen send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each\none bring a long piece of string.\u201d\n",
        "258": "The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at\nonce and get all her people. As soon as they heard her orders they ran\naway in every direction as fast as possible.\n\u201cNow,\u201d said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, \u201cyou must go to those\ntrees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.\u201d\n",
        "259": "So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon\nmade a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all\nthe leaves and branches. He fastened it together with wooden pegs and\nmade the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk. So fast\nand so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the\ntruck was all ready for them.\n",
        "260": "They came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big\nmice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a\npiece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke\nfrom her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to\nfind herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing\naround and looking at her timidly. But the Scarecrow told her about\n",
        "261": "everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:\n\u201cPermit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.\u201d\nDorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she\nbecame quite friendly with the little girl.\nThe Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the\ntruck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied\n",
        "262": "around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course\nthe truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to\ndraw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to\npull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit\non it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place\nwhere the Lion lay asleep.\n",
        "263": "After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed\nto get him up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people\nthe order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies\ntoo long they also would fall asleep.\nAt first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir\nthe heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed\nfrom behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out\n",
        "264": "of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet,\nfresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.\nDorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving\nher companion from death. She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was\nglad he had been rescued.\n",
        "265": "Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away\nthrough the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last to\nleave.\n\u201cIf ever you need us again,\u201d she said, \u201ccome out into the field and\ncall, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!\u201d\n",
        "266": "\u201cGood-bye!\u201d they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy\nheld Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.\nAfter this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and\nthe Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she\nate for her dinner.\n",
        "267": "Chapter X\nThe Guardian of the Gate\nIt was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain\namong the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance;\nbut when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad\nto find himself still alive.\n\u201cI ran as fast as I could,\u201d he said, sitting down and yawning, \u201cbut the\nflowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?\u201d\nThen they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved\nhim from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:\n\u201cI have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little\nthings as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as\nmice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what\n",
        "268": "shall we do now?\u201d\n\u201cWe must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,\u201d said\nDorothy, \u201cand then we can keep on to the Emerald City.\u201d\nSo, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again,\nthey all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through\nthe soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road\nof yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the\nGreat Oz dwelt.\n",

They passed by several of\nthese houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the\ndoors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no\none came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of\nwhich they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in\n",
        "270": "clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like\nthose of the Munchkins.\n\u201cThis must be the Land of Oz,\u201d said Dorothy, \u201cand we are surely getting\nnear the Emerald City.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered the Scarecrow. \u201cEverything is green here, while in the\n",

They walked over a\npavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined\ntogether were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the\nbrightness of the sun. The window panes were of green glass; even the\nsky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were\ngreen.\n",
        "300": "There were many people\u2014men, women, and children\u2014walking about, and\nthese were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They\nlooked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering\neyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when\nthey saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the\nstreet, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green. Green candy\n",
        "301": "and green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green\nhats, and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man was selling\ngreen lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that\nthey paid for it with green pennies.\nThere seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried\nthings around in little green carts, which they pushed before them.\n",
        "302": "Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.\nThe Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came\nto a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the\nPalace of Oz, the Great Wizard. There was a soldier before the door,\ndressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.\n",

When, at\nlast, he came back, Dorothy asked:\n\u201cHave you seen Oz?\u201d\n",

Beautiful green flowers stood in\nthe windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.\nWhen Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer\ngreen pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.\n",
        "309": "In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and\nvelvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.\n\u201cMake yourself perfectly at home,\u201d said the green girl, \u201cand if you\nwish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you tomorrow\nmorning.\u201d\n",
        "310": "She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led\nto rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant\npart of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the\nScarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood\nstupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It\n",

The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from\nforce of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not\nbeing able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down\nto make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have\npreferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being\nshut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so\nhe sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred\nhimself asleep in a minute.\n",
        "312": "The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch\nDorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of\ngreen brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a\ngreen ribbon around Toto\u2019s neck, and they started for the Throne Room\nof the Great Oz.\nFirst they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen\nof the court, all dressed in rich costumes.

In the center of the roof was a\ngreat light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a\nwonderful manner.\nBut what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble\nthat stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and\n",
        "317": "sparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair\nwas an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs\nwhatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose\nand mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.\n",
        "318": "As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly\nand looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and\nDorothy heard a voice say:\n\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\u201d\nIt was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big\nHead; so she took courage and answered:\n\u201cI am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.\u201d\n",
        "319": "The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the\nvoice:\n\u201cWhere did you get the silver shoes?\u201d\n\u201cI got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on\nher and killed her,\u201d she replied.\n",
        "320": "\u201cWhere did you get the mark upon your forehead?\u201d continued the voice.\n\u201cThat is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me\ngood-bye and sent me to you,\u201d said the girl.\nAgain the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the\ntruth. Then Oz asked, \u201cWhat do you wish me to do?\u201d\n",
        "321": "\u201cSend me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,\u201d she\nanswered earnestly. \u201cI don\u2019t like your country, although it is so\nbeautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my\nbeing away so long.\u201d\n",
        "322": "The eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and\ndown to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see\nevery part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.\n\u201cWhy should I do this for you?\u201d asked Oz.\n\u201cBecause you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard\nand I am only a little girl.\u201d\n",
        "323": "\u201cBut you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,\u201d said\nOz.\n\u201cThat just happened,\u201d returned Dorothy simply; \u201cI could not help it.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the Head, \u201cI will give you my answer. You have no right to\n",

        "330": "So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne\nRoom, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady.\nShe was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green\nlocks a crown of jewels. Growing from her shoulders were wings,\ngorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest\nbreath of air reached them.\n",
        "331": "When the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would\nlet him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly,\nand said:\n\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\u201d\nNow the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had\ntold him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.\n\u201cI am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains,\n",
        "332": "and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead\nof straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your\ndominions.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should I do this for you?\u201d asked the Lady.\n\u201cBecause you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,\u201d\nanswered the Scarecrow.\n",
        "333": "\u201cI never grant favors without some return,\u201d said Oz; \u201cbut this much I\nwill promise. If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I\nwill bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you\nwill be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,\u201d said the Scarecrow, in\nsurprise.\n",
        "334": "\u201cSo I did. I don\u2019t care who kills her. But until she is dead I will not\ngrant your wish. Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned\nthe brains you so greatly desire.\u201d\n",
        "335": "The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what\nOz had said; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard\nwas not a Head, as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady.\n\u201cAll the same,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cshe needs a heart as much as the\nTin Woodman.\u201d\nOn the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin\nWoodman and said:\n\u201cOz has sent for you.

The Beast had a head like that of a\n",

        "341": "\u201cBecause I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,\u201d answered the\nWoodman.\nOz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: \u201cIf you indeed desire a\nheart, you must earn it.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d asked the Woodman.\n",
        "342": "\u201cHelp Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,\u201d replied the Beast.\n\u201cWhen the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the\nbiggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.\u201d\nSo the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and\ntell them of the terrible Beast he had seen.

        "558": "\u201cThis is the second time you have called us,\u201d said the Monkey King,\nbowing before the little girl. \u201cWhat do you wish?\u201d\n\u201cI want you to fly with me to Kansas,\u201d said Dorothy.\nBut the Monkey King shook his head.\n",
        "559": "\u201cThat cannot be done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe belong to this country alone, and\ncannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet,\nand I suppose there never will be, for they don\u2019t belong there. We\n",

        "562": "\u201cLet us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,\u201d he said, \u201cand ask\nhis advice.\u201d\nSo the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for\nwhile Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.\n\u201cThis little girl,\u201d said the Scarecrow to the soldier, \u201cwishes to cross\nthe desert. How can she do so?\u201d\n",
        "563": "\u201cI cannot tell,\u201d answered the soldier, \u201cfor nobody has ever crossed the\ndesert, unless it is Oz himself.\u201d\n\u201cIs there no one who can help me?\u201d asked Dorothy earnestly.\n\u201cGlinda might,\u201d he suggested.\n",
        "564": "\u201cWho is Glinda?\u201d inquired the Scarecrow.\n\u201cThe Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches,\nand rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of\n",

        "568": "course, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.\u201d\n\u201cYou must have been thinking again,\u201d remarked the Tin Woodman.\n\u201cI have,\u201d said the Scarecrow.\n",
        "569": "\u201cI shall go with Dorothy,\u201d declared the Lion, \u201cfor I am tired of your\ncity and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wild\nbeast, you know.

        "571": "\u201cCertainly. If it wasn\u2019t for Dorothy I should never have had brains.\nShe lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the\nEmerald City.

        "574": "which he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to\ncarry with them.\n\u201cYou are now our ruler,\u201d he said to the Scarecrow; \u201cso you must come\nback to us as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cI certainly shall if I am able,\u201d the Scarecrow replied; \u201cbut I must\nhelp Dorothy to get home, first.\u201d\n",

        "578": "there, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how\ncourageous I have grown.\u201d\nThey now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City.

        "579": "\u201cOz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,\u201d said the Tin Woodman, as he\nfelt his heart rattling around in his breast.\n\u201cHe knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too,\u201d said the\nScarecrow.\n\u201cIf Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me,\u201d added the\nLion, \u201che would have been a brave man.\u201d\n",
        "580": "Dorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he\nhad done his best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was a good man,\neven if he was a bad Wizard.\n",

        "582": "was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and\nleft as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change\nthe direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked\nfor the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.\nThe Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with\nsuch wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass\nunderneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under\n",

But the Woodman promptly\n",
        "587": "chopped off the branch and set the little dog free.\nThe other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they\nmade up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down\ntheir branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the\nforest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out\nof it.\nThe four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came\nto the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found\n",
        "588": "before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was\nsmooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.\n\u201cWhat shall we do now?\u201d asked Dorothy.\n",
        "589": "\u201cI will make a ladder,\u201d said the Tin Woodman, \u201cfor we certainly must\nclimb over the wall.\u201d\nChapter XX\nThe Dainty China Country\nWhile the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the\nforest Dorothy lay down and slept, for she was tired by the long walk.\nThe Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him.\n",
        "590": "The Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked, and said to him:\n\u201cI cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of.\u201d\n\u201cRest your brains and do not worry about the wall,\u201d replied the\nWoodman. \u201cWhen we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the\nother side.\u201d\n",
        "591": "After a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin\nWoodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The\nScarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the\nladder was ready. The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was\n",
        "592": "so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from\nfalling off. When he got his head over the top of the wall the\nScarecrow said, \u201cOh, my!\u201d\n\u201cGo on,\u201d exclaimed Dorothy.\n",
        "593": "So the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the\nwall, and Dorothy put her head over and cried, \u201cOh, my!\u201d just as the\nScarecrow had done.\nThen Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him\nbe still.\n",
        "594": "The Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but\nboth of them cried, \u201cOh, my!\u201d as soon as they looked over the wall.\nWhen they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked\ndown and saw a strange sight.\nBefore them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and\nshining and white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around were\n",
        "595": "many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors.\nThese houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as\nhigh as Dorothy\u2019s waist. There were also pretty little barns, with\nchina fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs\nand chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.\n",
        "596": "But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer\ncountry. There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored\nbodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most\ngorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in\nknee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and\ngolden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon\ntheir heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns\nin ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall,\npointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were all made of\nchina, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of\nthem was no higher than Dorothy\u2019s knee.\n",
        "597": "No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little\npurple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and\nbarked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.\n\u201cHow shall we get down?\u201d asked Dorothy.\nThey found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the\nScarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that\nthe hard floor would not hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not\n",
        "598": "to light on his head and get the pins in their feet. When all were\nsafely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite\nflattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.\n\u201cWe must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,\u201d\nsaid Dorothy, \u201cfor it would be unwise for us to go any other way except\ndue South.\u201d\n",
        "599": "They began walking through the country of the china people, and the\nfirst thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As\nthey drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool,\nthe pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china\nground with a great clatter.\nDorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and\nthat the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor\nmilkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.\n",
        "600": "\u201cThere!\u201d cried the milkmaid angrily. \u201cSee what you have done! My cow\nhas broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender\u2019s shop and have\nit glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening my\ncow?\u201d\n",
        "601": "\u201cI\u2019m very sorry,\u201d returned Dorothy. \u201cPlease forgive us.\u201d\nBut the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She\npicked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping\non three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful\n",
        "602": "glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked\nelbow close to her side.\nDorothy was quite grieved at this mishap.\n\u201cWe must be very careful here,\u201d said the kind-hearted Woodman, \u201cor we\nmay hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it.\u201d\n",
        "603": "A little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young\nPrincess, who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run\naway.\nDorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her. But\nthe china girl cried out:\n\u201cDon\u2019t chase me! Don\u2019t chase me!\u201d\n",
        "604": "She had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said,\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cBecause,\u201d answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away,\n\u201cif I run I may fall down and break myself.\u201d\n\u201cBut could you not be mended?\u201d asked the girl.\n",
        "605": "\u201cOh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,\u201d\nreplied the Princess.\n\u201cI suppose not,\u201d said Dorothy.\n\u201cNow there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns,\u201d continued the china lady,\n",
        "606": "\u201cwho is always trying to stand upon his head. He has broken himself so\noften that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn\u2019t look at all\npretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself.\u201d\nIndeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy\ncould see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and\ngreen he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way\nand showing plainly that he had been mended in many places.\n",
        "607": "The Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his\ncheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:\n    \u201cMy lady fair,\n   Why do you stare\nAt poor old Mr. Joker?\n    You\u2019re quite as stiff\n    And prim as if\nYou\u2019d eaten up a poker!\u201d\n\u201cBe quiet, sir!\u201d said the Princess. \u201cCan\u2019t you see these are strangers,\n",
        "608": "and should be treated with respect?\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s respect, I expect,\u201d declared the Clown, and immediately\nstood upon his head.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind Mr. Joker,\u201d said the Princess to Dorothy. \u201cHe is\n",
        "609": "considerably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind him a bit,\u201d said Dorothy. \u201cBut you are so beautiful,\u201d\nshe continued, \u201cthat I am sure I could love you dearly. Won\u2019t you let\n",
        "610": "me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em\u2019s mantel? I could\ncarry you in my basket.\u201d\n\u201cThat would make me very unhappy,\u201d answered the china Princess. \u201cYou\n",
        "611": "see, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move\naround as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints\nat once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of\ncourse that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and\ncabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter\nhere in our own country.\u201d\n",
        "612": "\u201cI would not make you unhappy for all the world!\u201d exclaimed Dorothy.\n\u201cSo I\u2019ll just say good-bye.\u201d\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d replied the Princess.\n",
        "613": "They walked carefully through the china country. The little animals and\nall the people scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would\nbreak them, and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other\nside of the country and came to another china wall.\nIt was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the\nLion\u2019s back they all managed to scramble to the top. Then the Lion\n",
        "614": "gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall; but just as he\njumped, he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to\npieces.\n\u201cThat was too bad,\u201d said Dorothy, \u201cbut really I think we were lucky in\nnot doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow\u2019s leg and a\nchurch. They are all so brittle!\u201d\n\u201cThey are, indeed,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cand I am thankful I am made of\nstraw and cannot be easily damaged. There are worse things in the world\n",

        "616": "by carefully picking their way, they got safely along until they\nreached solid ground. But here the country seemed wilder than ever, and\nafter a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered\nanother forest, where the trees were bigger and older than any they had\never seen.\n\u201cThis forest is perfectly delightful,\u201d declared the Lion, looking\naround him with joy. \u201cNever have I seen a more beautiful place.\u201d\n",
        "617": "\u201cIt seems gloomy,\u201d said the Scarecrow.\n\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d answered the Lion. \u201cI should like to live here all\nmy life. See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich\n",
        "618": "and green the moss is that clings to these old trees. Surely no wild\nbeast could wish a pleasanter home.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now,\u201d said Dorothy.\n",

Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep, while the\nWoodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual.\n",
        "620": "When morning came, they started again. Before they had gone far they\nheard a low rumble, as of the growling of many wild animals.

There\n",

But\nthe Lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting, and he\njudged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble.\nAs he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him, and at once the\ngreat assemblage hushed as if by magic.

        "623": "\u201cWe are all threatened,\u201d answered the tiger, \u201cby a fierce enemy which\nhas lately come into this forest. It is a most tremendous monster, like\na great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a\ntree trunk. It has eight of these long legs, and as the monster crawls\nthrough the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his\nmouth, where he eats it as a spider does a fly. Not one of us is safe\n",

This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to\nattack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep\nthan awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the\nmonster\u2019s back. Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with\n",
        "629": "sharp claws, he knocked the spider\u2019s head from its body. Jumping down,\nhe watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was\nquite dead.\nThe Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were\nwaiting for him and said proudly:\n\u201cYou need fear your enemy no longer.\u201d\n",
        "630": "Then the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King, and he promised\nto come back and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her\nway to Kansas.\nChapter XXII\nThe Country of the Quadlings\nThe four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety, and\nwhen they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill, covered\nfrom top to bottom with great pieces of rock.\n\u201cThat will be a hard climb,\u201d said the Scarecrow, \u201cbut we must get over\nthe hill, nevertheless.\u201d\n",
        "631": "So he led the way and the others followed. They had nearly reached the\nfirst rock when they heard a rough voice cry out, \u201cKeep back!\u201d\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\n",
        "632": "Then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, \u201cThis\nhill belongs to us, and we don\u2019t allow anyone to cross it.\u201d\n\u201cBut we must cross it,\u201d said the Scarecrow. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the country\nof the Quadlings.\u201d\n",
        "633": "\u201cBut you shall not!\u201d replied the voice, and there stepped from behind\nthe rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen.\nHe was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the\ntop and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles. But he had no arms\n",
        "634": "at all, and, seeing this, the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a\ncreature could prevent them from climbing the hill. So he said, \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether\nyou like it or not,\u201d and he walked boldly forward.\nAs quick as lightning the man\u2019s head shot forward and his neck\nstretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the\nScarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the\nhill. Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and\n",

        "636": "Again a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion went rolling down the\nhill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball.\nDorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet, and the Lion\ncame up to her, feeling rather bruised and sore, and said, \u201cIt is\nuseless to fight people with shooting heads; no one can withstand\nthem.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can we do, then?\u201d she asked.\n",
        "637": "\u201cCall the Winged Monkeys,\u201d suggested the Tin Woodman. \u201cYou have still\nthe right to command them once more.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d she answered, and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered\nthe magic words. The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a few\n",
        "638": "moments the entire band stood before her.\n\u201cWhat are your commands?\u201d inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing low.\n\u201cCarry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,\u201d answered the\ngirl.\n",
        "639": "\u201cIt shall be done,\u201d said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys\ncaught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with\nthem. As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with\nvexation, and shot their heads high in the air, but they could not\nreach the Winged Monkeys, which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely\nover the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the\nQuadlings.\n\u201cThis is the last time you can summon us,\u201d said the leader to Dorothy;\n\u201cso good-bye and good luck to you.\u201d\n",
        "640": "\u201cGood-bye, and thank you very much,\u201d returned the girl; and the Monkeys\nrose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling.\nThe country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy. There was field\nupon field of ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between,\nand pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them. The fences\n",

The Quadlings themselves, who were short and\nfat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all in red, which\nshowed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain.\nThe Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers\nwalked up to it and knocked at the door.

        "643": "the South and you will soon reach it.\u201d\nThanking the good woman, they started afresh and walked by the fields\nand across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very\nbeautiful Castle. Before the gates were three young girls, dressed in\nhandsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid; and as Dorothy\napproached, one of them said to her:\n\u201cWhy have you come to the South Country?\u201d\n",
        "644": "\u201cTo see the Good Witch who rules here,\u201d she answered. \u201cWill you take me\nto her?\u201d\n\u201cLet me have your name, and I will ask Glinda if she will receive you.\u201d\n",

        "647": "pure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the\nlittle girl.\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, my child?\u201d she asked.\nDorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her\nto the Land of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of the\nwonderful adventures they had met with.\n",
        "648": "\u201cMy greatest wish now,\u201d she added, \u201cis to get back to Kansas, for Aunt\nEm will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that\nwill make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this\nyear than they were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it.\u201d\nGlinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving\nlittle girl.\n\u201cBless your dear heart,\u201d she said, \u201cI am sure I can tell you of a way\nto get back to Kansas.\u201d Then she added, \u201cBut, if I do, you must give me\n",

        "650": "\u201cAnd I think I shall need their service just those three times,\u201d\nanswered Glinda, smiling.\nDorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the\nScarecrow, \u201cWhat will you do when Dorothy has left us?\u201d\n\u201cI will return to the Emerald City,\u201d he replied, \u201cfor Oz has made me\nits ruler and the people like me.

        "652": "\u201cYou are unusual,\u201d replied Glinda.\nTurning to the Tin Woodman, she asked, \u201cWhat will become of you when\nDorothy leaves this country?\u201d\nHe leaned on his axe and thought a moment. Then he said, \u201cThe Winkies\n",
