        "14": "Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814. He was one of the\nmost noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to\navoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little\nwas known, except that he was a polished man of the world. People said\nthat he resembled Byron\u2014at least that his head was Byronic; but he was\na bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without\ngrowing old.\n",
        "15": "Certainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was\na Londoner. He was never seen on \u2019Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the\ncounting-rooms of the \u201cCity\u201d; no ships ever came into London docks of\nwhich he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been\nentered at any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln\u2019s\nInn, or Gray\u2019s Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of\nChancery, or in the Exchequer, or the Queen\u2019s Bench, or the\nEcclesiastical Courts. He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he\na merchant or a gentleman farmer. His name was strange to the\n",
        "16": "scientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part\nin the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London\nInstitution, the Artisan\u2019s Association, or the Institution of Arts and\nSciences. He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous societies which\nswarm in the English capital, from the Harmonic to that of the\nEntomologists, founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious\ninsects.\nPhileas Fogg was a member of the Reform, and that was all.\n",
        "17": "The way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple\nenough.\nHe was recommended by the Barings, with whom he had an open credit. His\ncheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current, which\nwas always flush.\n",
        "18": "Was Phileas Fogg rich? Undoubtedly. But those who knew him best could\nnot imagine how he had made his fortune, and Mr. Fogg was the last\nperson to whom to apply for the information. He was not lavish, nor, on\n",
        "19": "the contrary, avaricious; for, whenever he knew that money was needed\nfor a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose, he supplied it quietly and\nsometimes anonymously. He was, in short, the least communicative of\nmen. He talked very little, and seemed all the more mysterious for his\ntaciturn manner. His daily habits were quite open to observation; but\n",
        "20": "whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done\nbefore, that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled.\nHad he travelled? It was likely, for no one seemed to know the world\nmore familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear\nto have an intimate acquaintance with it. He often corrected, with a\n",
        "21": "few clear words, the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the\nclub as to lost and unheard-of travellers, pointing out the true\nprobabilities, and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight, so\noften did events justify his predictions. He must have travelled\neverywhere, at least in the spirit.\nIt was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from\nLondon for many years. Those who were honoured by a better acquaintance\n",
        "22": "with him than the rest, declared that nobody could pretend to have ever\nseen him anywhere else. His sole pastimes were reading the papers and\nplaying whist. He often won at this game, which, as a silent one,\nharmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went into his purse,\nbeing reserved as a fund for his charities. Mr. Fogg played, not to\n",
        "23": "win, but for the sake of playing. The game was in his eyes a contest, a\nstruggle with a difficulty, yet a motionless, unwearying struggle,\ncongenial to his tastes.\nPhileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children, which may\nhappen to the most honest people; either relatives or near friends,\nwhich is certainly more unusual. He lived alone in his house in Saville\n",
        "24": "Row, whither none penetrated. A single domestic sufficed to serve him.\nHe breakfasted and dined at the club, at hours mathematically fixed, in\nthe same room, at the same table, never taking his meals with other\nmembers, much less bringing a guest with him; and went home at exactly\nmidnight, only to retire at once to bed. He never used the cosy\nchambers which the Reform provides for its favoured members. He passed\n",
        "25": "ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row, either in sleeping or\nmaking his toilet. When he chose to take a walk it was with a regular\nstep in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring, or in the circular\ngallery with its dome supported by twenty red porphyry Ionic columns,\nand illumined by blue painted windows. When he breakfasted or dined all\nthe resources of the club\u2014its kitchens and pantries, its buttery and\ndairy\u2014aided to crowd his table with their most succulent stores; he was\nserved by the gravest waiters, in dress coats, and shoes with swan-skin\nsoles, who proffered the viands in special porcelain, and on the finest\nlinen; club decanters, of a lost mould, contained his sherry, his port,\nand his cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly\ncooled with ice, brought at great cost from the American lakes.\n",
        "26": "If to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed that\nthere is something good in eccentricity.\nThe mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly\ncomfortable. The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but\nlittle from the sole domestic, but Phileas Fogg required him to be\nalmost superhumanly prompt and regular. On this very 2nd of October he\n",
        "27": "had dismissed James Forster, because that luckless youth had brought\nhim shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of\neighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor, who was due at the house\nbetween eleven and half-past.\nPhileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair, his feet close\ntogether like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands resting on his\nknees, his body straight, his head erect; he was steadily watching a\ncomplicated clock which indicated the hours, the minutes, the seconds,\nthe days, the months, and the years. At exactly half-past eleven Mr.\nFogg would, according to his daily habit, quit Saville Row, and repair\nto the Reform.\n",
        "28": "A rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where\nPhileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed servant,\nappeared.\n\u201cThe new servant,\u201d said he.\nA young man of thirty advanced and bowed.\n",
        "29": "\u201cYou are a Frenchman, I believe,\u201d asked Phileas Fogg, \u201cand your name is\nJohn?\u201d\n\u201cJean, if monsieur pleases,\u201d replied the newcomer, \u201cJean Passepartout,\na surname which has clung to me because I have a natural aptness for\ngoing out of one business into another. I believe I\u2019m honest, monsieur,\nbut, to be outspoken, I\u2019ve had several trades. I\u2019ve been an itinerant\n",
        "30": "singer, a circus-rider, when I used to vault like Leotard, and dance on\na rope like Blondin. Then I got to be a professor of gymnastics, so as\nto make better use of my talents; and then I was a sergeant fireman at\nParis, and assisted at many a big fire. But I quitted France five years\nago, and, wishing to taste the sweets of domestic life, took service as\na valet here in England. Finding myself out of place, and hearing that\n",
        "31": "Monsieur Phileas Fogg was the most exact and settled gentleman in the\nUnited Kingdom, I have come to monsieur in the hope of living with him\na tranquil life, and forgetting even the name of Passepartout.\u201d\n\u201cPassepartout suits me,\u201d responded Mr. Fogg. \u201cYou are well recommended\nto me; I hear a good report of you. You know my conditions?\u201d\n",
        "32": "\u201cYes, monsieur.\u201d\n\u201cGood! What time is it?\u201d\n\u201cTwenty-two minutes after eleven,\u201d returned Passepartout, drawing an\nenormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket.\n",
        "33": "\u201cYou are too slow,\u201d said Mr. Fogg.\n\u201cPardon me, monsieur, it is impossible\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou are four minutes too slow. No matter; it\u2019s enough to mention the\nerror. Now from this moment, twenty-nine minutes after eleven, a.m.,\n",
        "34": "this Wednesday, 2nd October, you are in my service.\u201d\nPhileas Fogg got up, took his hat in his left hand, put it on his head\nwith an automatic motion, and went off without a word.\nPassepartout heard the street door shut once; it was his new master\ngoing out. He heard it shut again; it was his predecessor, James\n",
        "35": "Forster, departing in his turn. Passepartout remained alone in the\nhouse in Saville Row.\nCHAPTER II.\n",
        "36": "IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT IS CONVINCED THAT HE HAS AT LAST FOUND HIS IDEAL\n\u201cFaith,\u201d muttered Passepartout, somewhat flurried, \u201cI\u2019ve seen people at\nMadame Tussaud\u2019s as lively as my new master!\u201d\nMadame Tussaud\u2019s \u201cpeople,\u201d let it be said, are of wax, and are much\nvisited in London; speech is all that is wanting to make them human.\nDuring his brief interview with Mr. Fogg, Passepartout had been\n",
        "37": "carefully observing him. He appeared to be a man about forty years of\nage, with fine, handsome features, and a tall, well-shaped figure; his\nhair and whiskers were light, his forehead compact and unwrinkled, his\nface rather pale, his teeth magnificent. His countenance possessed in\nthe highest degree what physiognomists call \u201crepose in action,\u201d a\nquality of those who act rather than talk. Calm and phlegmatic, with a\n",
        "38": "clear eye, Mr. Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure\nwhich Angelica Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas. Seen\nin the various phases of his daily life, he gave the idea of being\nperfectly well-balanced, as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer.\n",
        "39": "Phileas Fogg was, indeed, exactitude personified, and this was betrayed\neven in the expression of his very hands and feet; for in men, as well\nas in animals, the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions.\nHe was so exact that he was never in a hurry, was always ready, and was\neconomical alike of his steps and his motions. He never took one step\ntoo many, and always went to his destination by the shortest cut; he\nmade no superfluous gestures, and was never seen to be moved or\nagitated. He was the most deliberate person in the world, yet always\n",
        "40": "reached his destination at the exact moment.\nHe lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social relation; and\nas he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction, and\nthat friction retards, he never rubbed against anybody.\nAs for Passepartout, he was a true Parisian of Paris. Since he had\n",
        "41": "abandoned his own country for England, taking service as a valet, he\nhad in vain searched for a master after his own heart. Passepartout was\nby no means one of those pert dunces depicted by Moli\u00e8re with a bold\ngaze and a nose held high in the air; he was an honest fellow, with a\npleasant face, lips a trifle protruding, soft-mannered and serviceable,\nwith a good round head, such as one likes to see on the shoulders of a\nfriend. His eyes were blue, his complexion rubicund, his figure almost\nportly and well-built, his body muscular, and his physical powers fully\ndeveloped by the exercises of his younger days. His brown hair was\n",
        "42": "somewhat tumbled; for, while the ancient sculptors are said to have\nknown eighteen methods of arranging Minerva\u2019s tresses, Passepartout was\nfamiliar with but one of dressing his own: three strokes of a\nlarge-tooth comb completed his toilet.\nIt would be rash to predict how Passepartout\u2019s lively nature would\nagree with Mr. Fogg. It was impossible to tell whether the new servant\nwould turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required;\nexperience alone could solve the question. Passepartout had been a sort\n",
        "43": "of vagrant in his early years, and now yearned for repose; but so far\nhe had failed to find it, though he had already served in ten English\nhouses. But he could not take root in any of these; with chagrin, he\nfound his masters invariably whimsical and irregular, constantly\nrunning about the country, or on the look-out for adventure. His last\nmaster, young Lord Longferry, Member of Parliament, after passing his\nnights in the Haymarket taverns, was too often brought home in the\nmorning on policemen\u2019s shoulders. Passepartout, desirous of respecting\n",
        "44": "the gentleman whom he served, ventured a mild remonstrance on such\nconduct; which, being ill-received, he took his leave. Hearing that Mr.\nPhileas Fogg was looking for a servant, and that his life was one of\nunbroken regularity, that he neither travelled nor stayed from home\novernight, he felt sure that this would be the place he was after. He\npresented himself, and was accepted, as has been seen.\n",
        "45": "At half-past eleven, then, Passepartout found himself alone in the\nhouse in Saville Row. He began its inspection without delay, scouring\nit from cellar to garret. So clean, well-arranged, solemn a mansion\npleased him; it seemed to him like a snail\u2019s shell, lighted and warmed\nby gas, which sufficed for both these purposes. When Passepartout\n",
        "46": "reached the second story he recognised at once the room which he was to\ninhabit, and he was well satisfied with it. Electric bells and\nspeaking-tubes afforded communication with the lower stories; while on\nthe mantel stood an electric clock, precisely like that in Mr. Fogg\u2019s\nbedchamber, both beating the same second at the same instant. \u201cThat\u2019s\n",
        "47": "good, that\u2019ll do,\u201d said Passepartout to himself.\nHe suddenly observed, hung over the clock, a card which, upon\ninspection, proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the house.\nIt comprised all that was required of the servant, from eight in the\nmorning, exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose, till half-past\neleven, when he left the house for the Reform Club\u2014all the details of\nservice, the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight, the\nshaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine, and the toilet at\ntwenty minutes before ten. Everything was regulated and foreseen that\n",

        "49": "of trousers, coat, and vest bore a number, indicating the time of year\nand season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing; and\nthe same system was applied to the master\u2019s shoes. In short, the house\nin Saville Row, which must have been a very temple of disorder and\nunrest under the illustrious but dissipated Sheridan, was cosiness,\ncomfort, and method idealised. There was no study, nor were there\nbooks, which would have been quite useless to Mr. Fogg; for at the\n",
        "50": "Reform two libraries, one of general literature and the other of law\nand politics, were at his service. A moderate-sized safe stood in his\nbedroom, constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars; but\nPassepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere;\neverything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits.\nHaving scrutinised the house from top to bottom, he rubbed his hands, a\nbroad smile overspread his features, and he said joyfully, \u201cThis is\njust what I wanted! Ah, we shall get on together, Mr. Fogg and I! What\n",

He repaired\nat once to the dining-room, the nine windows of which open upon a\ntasteful garden, where the trees were already gilded with an autumn\ncolouring; and took his place at the habitual table, the cover of which\nhad already been laid for him. His breakfast consisted of a side-dish,\na broiled fish with Reading sauce, a scarlet slice of roast beef\ngarnished with mushrooms, a rhubarb and gooseberry tart, and a morsel\nof Cheshire cheese, the whole being washed down with several cups of\ntea, for which the Reform is famous.

        "284": "Returning to the Indian, whose small, sharp eyes, glistening with\navarice, betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a\nprice he could obtain.

This line,\nowing to the capricious turnings of the Vindhia Mountains, did not\npursue a straight course. The Parsee, who was quite familiar with the\nroads and paths in the district, declared that they would gain twenty\nmiles by striking directly through the forest.\n",
        "290": "Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, plunged to the neck in the\npeculiar howdahs provided for them, were horribly jostled by the swift\ntrotting of the elephant, spurred on as he was by the skilful Parsee;\nbut they endured the discomfort with true British phlegm, talking\nlittle, and scarcely able to catch a glimpse of each other. As for\nPassepartout, who was mounted on the beast\u2019s back, and received the\ndirect force of each concussion as he trod along, he was very careful,\nin accordance with his master\u2019s advice, to keep his tongue from between\nhis teeth, as it would otherwise have been bitten off short. The worthy\nfellow bounced from the elephant\u2019s neck to his rump, and vaulted like a\nclown on a spring-board; yet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing,\nand from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his pocket, and\ninserted it in Kiouni\u2019s trunk, who received it without in the least\nslackening his regular trot.\n",
        "291": "After two hours the guide stopped the elephant, and gave him an hour\nfor rest, during which Kiouni, after quenching his thirst at a\nneighbouring spring, set to devouring the branches and shrubs round\nabout him. Neither Sir Francis nor Mr. Fogg regretted the delay, and\nboth descended with a feeling of relief. \u201cWhy, he\u2019s made of iron!\u201d\nexclaimed the general, gazing admiringly on Kiouni.\n",
        "292": "\u201cOf forged iron,\u201d replied Passepartout, as he set about preparing a\nhasty breakfast.\nAt noon the Parsee gave the signal of departure. The country soon\npresented a very savage aspect. Copses of dates and dwarf-palms\n",

All this portion of\nBundelcund, which is little frequented by travellers, is inhabited by a\nfanatical population, hardened in the most horrible practices of the\nHindoo faith. The English have not been able to secure complete\ndominion over this territory, which is subjected to the influence of\nrajahs, whom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessible\nmountain fastnesses. The travellers several times saw bands of\n",
        "294": "ferocious Indians, who, when they perceived the elephant striding\nacross-country, made angry and threatening motions. The Parsee avoided\nthem as much as possible. Few animals were observed on the route; even\nthe monkeys hurried from their path with contortions and grimaces which\nconvulsed Passepartout with laughter.\n",
        "295": "In the midst of his gaiety, however, one thought troubled the worthy\nservant. What would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant when he got to\nAllahabad? Would he carry him on with him? Impossible! The cost of\ntransporting him would make him ruinously expensive. Would he sell him,\n",
        "296": "or set him free? The estimable beast certainly deserved some\nconsideration. Should Mr. Fogg choose to make him, Passepartout, a\npresent of Kiouni, he would be very much embarrassed; and these\nthoughts did not cease worrying him for a long time.\n",
        "297": "The principal chain of the Vindhias was crossed by eight in the\nevening, and another halt was made on the northern slope, in a ruined\nbungalow.

        "301": "resuming his rapid gait, soon descended the lower spurs of the\nVindhias, and towards noon they passed by the village of Kallenger, on\nthe Cani, one of the branches of the Ganges.

They had not as\nyet had any unpleasant encounters, and the journey seemed on the point\nof being successfully accomplished, when the elephant, becoming\nrestless, suddenly stopped.\n",
        "303": "It was then four o\u2019clock.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked Sir Francis, putting out his head.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, officer,\u201d replied the Parsee, listening attentively to a\nconfused murmur which came through the thick branches.\n",
        "304": "The murmur soon became more distinct; it now seemed like a distant\nconcert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments. Passepartout\nwas all eyes and ears. Mr. Fogg patiently waited without a word. The\nParsee jumped to the ground, fastened the elephant to a tree, and\nplunged into the thicket. He soon returned, saying:\n",

Next came the musicians and\na rearguard of capering fakirs, whose cries sometimes drowned the noise\nof the instruments; these closed the procession.\nSir Francis watched the procession with a sad countenance, and, turning\nto the guide, said, \u201cA suttee.\u201d\n",
        "312": "The Parsee nodded, and put his finger to his lips. The procession\nslowly wound under the trees, and soon its last ranks disappeared in\nthe depths of the wood. The songs gradually died away; occasionally\ncries were heard in the distance, until at last all was silence again.\n",
        "313": "Phileas Fogg had heard what Sir Francis said, and, as soon as the\nprocession had disappeared, asked: \u201cWhat is a suttee?\u201d\n\u201cA suttee,\u201d returned the general, \u201cis a human sacrifice, but a\nvoluntary one.

        "316": "is the theatre of incessant murders and pillage.\u201d\n\u201cThe poor wretch!\u201d exclaimed Passepartout, \u201cto be burned alive!\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d returned Sir Francis, \u201cburned alive. And, if she were not, you\n",
        "317": "cannot conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from\nher relatives. They would shave off her hair, feed her on a scanty\nallowance of rice, treat her with contempt; she would be looked upon as\nan unclean creature, and would die in some corner, like a scurvy dog.\nThe prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures\nto the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism.\n",
        "318": "Sometimes, however, the sacrifice is really voluntary, and it requires\nthe active interference of the Government to prevent it. Several years\nago, when I was living at Bombay, a young widow asked permission of the\ngovernor to be burned along with her husband\u2019s body; but, as you may\nimagine, he refused. The woman left the town, took refuge with an\nindependent rajah, and there carried out her self-devoted purpose.\u201d\n",
        "319": "While Sir Francis was speaking, the guide shook his head several times,\nand now said: \u201cThe sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is\nnot a voluntary one.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n\u201cEverybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund.\u201d\n",

        "332": "They then discussed the means of getting at the victim. The guide was\nfamiliar with the pagoda of Pillaji, in which, as he declared, the\nyoung woman was imprisoned.

        "416": "\u201cThe facts are admitted?\u201d asked the judge.\n\u201cAdmitted,\u201d replied Mr. Fogg, coldly.\n\u201cInasmuch,\u201d resumed the judge, \u201cas the English law protects equally and\nsternly the religions of the Indian people, and as the man Passepartout\nhas admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of Malabar Hill, at\nBombay, on the 20th of October, I condemn the said Passepartout to\nimprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred pounds.\u201d\n",
        "417": "\u201cThree hundred pounds!\u201d cried Passepartout, startled at the largeness\nof the sum.\n\u201cSilence!\u201d shouted the constable.\n",
        "418": "\u201cAnd inasmuch,\u201d continued the judge, \u201cas it is not proved that the act\nwas not done by the connivance of the master with the servant, and as\nthe master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his\npaid servant, I condemn Phileas Fogg to a week\u2019s imprisonment and a\nfine of one hundred and fifty pounds.\u201d\nFix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction; if Phileas Fogg could be\ndetained in Calcutta a week, it would be more than time for the warrant\nto arrive.

She was as fast, but not as well fitted up,\nas the \u201cMongolia,\u201d and Aouda was not as comfortably provided for on\nboard of her as Phileas Fogg could have wished. However, the trip from\nCalcutta to Hong Kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred\nmiles, occupying from ten to twelve days, and the young woman was not\ndifficult to please.\n",
        "429": "During the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted\nwith her protector, and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude\nfor what he had done. The phlegmatic gentleman listened to her,\napparently at least, with coldness, neither his voice nor his manner\nbetraying the slightest emotion; but he seemed to be always on the\nwatch that nothing should be wanting to Aouda\u2019s comfort. He visited her\nregularly each day at certain hours, not so much to talk himself, as to\nsit and hear her talk. He treated her with the strictest politeness,\n",
        "430": "but with the precision of an automaton, the movements of which had been\narranged for this purpose. Aouda did not quite know what to make of\nhim, though Passepartout had given her some hints of his master\u2019s\neccentricity, and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was\nsending him round the world. After all, she owed Phileas Fogg her life,\nand she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her\ngratitude.\n",
        "431": "Aouda confirmed the Parsee guide\u2019s narrative of her touching history.\nShe did, indeed, belong to the highest of the native races of India.\nMany of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing\nin cotton; and one of them, Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy, was made a baronet\nby the English government. Aouda was a relative of this great man, and\n",
        "432": "it was his cousin, Jeejeeh, whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong.\nWhether she would find a protector in him she could not tell; but Mr.\nFogg essayed to calm her anxieties, and to assure her that everything\nwould be mathematically\u2014he used the very word\u2014arranged.

The steamer passed along near the shores, but the\nsavage Papuans, who are in the lowest scale of humanity, but are not,\nas has been asserted, cannibals, did not make their appearance.\n",
        "434": "The panorama of the islands, as they steamed by them, was superb. Vast\nforests of palms, arecs, bamboo, teakwood, of the gigantic mimosa, and\ntree-like ferns covered the foreground, while behind, the graceful\noutlines of the mountains were traced against the sky; and along the\ncoasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a\nluxurious dish to the tables of the Celestial Empire. The varied\nlandscape afforded by the Andaman Islands was soon passed, however, and\nthe \u201cRangoon\u201d rapidly approached the Straits of Malacca, which gave\naccess to the China seas.\n",
        "435": "What was detective Fix, so unluckily drawn on from country to country,\ndoing all this while? He had managed to embark on the \u201cRangoon\u201d at\nCalcutta without being seen by Passepartout, after leaving orders that,\nif the warrant should arrive, it should be forwarded to him at Hong\nKong; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage. It\nwould have been difficult to explain why he was on board without\nawakening Passepartout\u2019s suspicions, who thought him still at Bombay.\n",
        "436": "But necessity impelled him, nevertheless, to renew his acquaintance\nwith the worthy servant, as will be seen.\nAll the detective\u2019s hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong Kong; for\nthe steamer\u2019s stay at Singapore would be too brief to enable him to\ntake any steps there. The arrest must be made at Hong Kong, or the\nrobber would probably escape him for ever. Hong Kong was the last\n",
        "437": "English ground on which he would set foot; beyond, China, Japan,\nAmerica offered to Fogg an almost certain refuge. If the warrant should\nat last make its appearance at Hong Kong, Fix could arrest him and give\nhim into the hands of the local police, and there would be no further\ntrouble. But beyond Hong Kong, a simple warrant would be of no avail;\nan extradition warrant would be necessary, and that would result in\ndelays and obstacles, of which the rascal would take advantage to elude\njustice.\n",
        "438": "Fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he\nspent in his cabin, and kept repeating to himself, \u201cNow, either the\nwarrant will be at Hong Kong, in which case I shall arrest my man, or\nit will not be there; and this time it is absolutely necessary that I\nshould delay his departure. I have failed at Bombay, and I have failed\nat Calcutta; if I fail at Hong Kong, my reputation is lost: Cost what\nit may, I _must_ succeed! But how shall I prevent his departure, if\nthat should turn out to be my last resource?\u201d\n",
        "439": "Fix made up his mind that, if worst came to worst, he would make a\nconfidant of Passepartout, and tell him what kind of a fellow his\nmaster really was. That Passepartout was not Fogg\u2019s accomplice, he was\nvery certain. The servant, enlightened by his disclosure, and afraid of\nbeing himself implicated in the crime, would doubtless become an ally\nof the detective. But this method was a dangerous one, only to be\n",
        "440": "employed when everything else had failed. A word from Passepartout to\nhis master would ruin all. The detective was therefore in a sore\nstrait. But suddenly a new idea struck him. The presence of Aouda on\n",
        "441": "the \u201cRangoon,\u201d in company with Phileas Fogg, gave him new material for\nreflection.\nWho was this woman? What combination of events had made her Fogg\u2019s\ntravelling companion? They had evidently met somewhere between Bombay\n",
        "442": "and Calcutta; but where? Had they met accidentally, or had Fogg gone\ninto the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel? Fix was\nfairly puzzled. He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked\n",
        "443": "elopement; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he\ndetermined to make use of the supposed intrigue. Whether the young\nwoman were married or not, he would be able to create such difficulties\nfor Mr. Fogg at Hong Kong that he could not escape by paying any amount\nof money.\n",
        "444": "But could he even wait till they reached Hong Kong? Fogg had an\nabominable way of jumping from one boat to another, and, before\nanything could be effected, might get full under way again for\nYokohama.\nFix decided that he must warn the English authorities, and signal the\n\u201cRangoon\u201d before her arrival. This was easy to do, since the steamer\n",
        "445": "stopped at Singapore, whence there is a telegraphic wire to Hong Kong.\nHe finally resolved, moreover, before acting more positively, to\nquestion Passepartout. It would not be difficult to make him talk; and,\nas there was no time to lose, Fix prepared to make himself known.\n",
        "446": "It was now the 30th of October, and on the following day the \u201cRangoon\u201d\nwas due at Singapore.\nFix emerged from his cabin and went on deck. Passepartout was\npromenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer. The\n",

        "448": "at Bombay, and here you are, on the way to Hong Kong! Are you going\nround the world too?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d replied Fix; \u201cI shall stop at Hong Kong\u2014at least for some\ndays.\u201d\n",
        "449": "\u201cHum!\u201d said Passepartout, who seemed for an instant perplexed. \u201cBut how\nis it I have not seen you on board since we left Calcutta?\u201d\n\u201cOh, a trifle of sea-sickness\u2014I\u2019ve been staying in my berth. The Gulf\n",

        "452": "Passepartout thereupon recounted Aouda\u2019s history, the affair at the\nBombay pagoda, the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds,\nthe rescue, the arrest, and sentence of the Calcutta court, and the\nrestoration of Mr. Fogg and himself to liberty on bail. Fix, who was\nfamiliar with the last events, seemed to be equally ignorant of all\nthat Passepartout related; and the later was charmed to find so\ninterested a listener.\n\u201cBut does your master propose to carry this young woman to Europe?\u201d\n",
        "453": "\u201cNot at all. We are simply going to place her under the protection of\none of her relatives, a rich merchant at Hong Kong.\u201d\n\u201cNothing to be done there,\u201d said Fix to himself, concealing his\ndisappointment. \u201cA glass of gin, Mr. Passepartout?\u201d\n",
        "454": "\u201cWillingly, Monsieur Fix. We must at least have a friendly glass on\nboard the \u2018Rangoon.\u2019\u201d\nCHAPTER XVII.\n",
        "455": "SHOWING WHAT HAPPENED ON THE VOYAGE FROM SINGAPORE TO HONG KONG\nThe detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this interview,\nthough Fix was reserved, and did not attempt to induce his companion to\ndivulge any more facts concerning Mr. Fogg. He caught a glimpse of that\nmysterious gentleman once or twice; but Mr. Fogg usually confined\nhimself to the cabin, where he kept Aouda company, or, according to his\ninveterate habit, took a hand at whist.\n",
        "456": "Passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance\nkept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing. It was really\nworth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent\nperson, whom he had first met at Suez, had then encountered on board\nthe \u201cMongolia,\u201d who disembarked at Bombay, which he announced as his\ndestination, and now turned up so unexpectedly on the \u201cRangoon,\u201d was\nfollowing Mr. Fogg\u2019s tracks step by step. What was Fix\u2019s object?\nPassepartout was ready to wager his Indian shoes\u2014which he religiously\npreserved\u2014that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with\nthem, and probably on the same steamer.\n",
        "457": "Passepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without\nhitting upon the real object which the detective had in view. He never\ncould have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as a robber\naround the globe. But, as it is in human nature to attempt the solution\nof every mystery, Passepartout suddenly discovered an explanation of\nFix\u2019s movements, which was in truth far from unreasonable. Fix, he\n",
        "458": "thought, could only be an agent of Mr. Fogg\u2019s friends at the Reform\nClub, sent to follow him up, and to ascertain that he really went round\nthe world as had been agreed upon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear!\u201d repeated the worthy servant to himself, proud of his\n",
        "459": "shrewdness. \u201cHe\u2019s a spy sent to keep us in view! That isn\u2019t quite the\nthing, either, to be spying Mr. Fogg, who is so honourable a man! Ah,\ngentlemen of the Reform, this shall cost you dear!\u201d\n",
        "460": "Passepartout, enchanted with his discovery, resolved to say nothing to\nhis master, lest he should be justly offended at this mistrust on the\npart of his adversaries. But he determined to chaff Fix, when he had\nthe chance, with mysterious allusions, which, however, need not betray\nhis real suspicions.\nDuring the afternoon of Wednesday, 30th October, the \u201cRangoon\u201d entered\nthe Strait of Malacca, which separates the peninsula of that name from\nSumatra. The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of\n",
        "461": "this noble island from the view of the travellers. The \u201cRangoon\u201d\nweighed anchor at Singapore the next day at four a.m., to receive coal,\nhaving gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival. Phileas\n",
        "462": "Fogg noted this gain in his journal, and then, accompanied by Aouda,\nwho betrayed a desire for a walk on shore, disembarked.\nFix, who suspected Mr. Fogg\u2019s every movement, followed them cautiously,\nwithout being himself perceived; while Passepartout, laughing in his\nsleeve at Fix\u2019s man\u0153uvres, went about his usual errands.\n",
        "463": "The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect, for there are no\nmountains; yet its appearance is not without attractions. It is a park\ncheckered by pleasant highways and avenues. A handsome carriage, drawn\nby a sleek pair of New Holland horses, carried Phileas Fogg and Aouda\ninto the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage, and of\nclove-trees, whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower.\n",
        "464": "Pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of European fields;\nsago-bushes, large ferns with gorgeous branches, varied the aspect of\nthis tropical clime; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air\nwith a penetrating perfume. Agile and grinning bands of monkeys skipped\nabout in the trees, nor were tigers wanting in the jungles.\nAfter a drive of two hours through the country, Aouda and Mr. Fogg\n",
        "465": "returned to the town, which is a vast collection of heavy-looking,\nirregular houses, surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical\nfruits and plants; and at ten o\u2019clock they re-embarked, closely\nfollowed by the detective, who had kept them constantly in sight.\nPassepartout, who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes\u2014a fruit as\nlarge as good-sized apples, of a dark-brown colour outside and a bright\nred within, and whose white pulp, melting in the mouth, affords\ngourmands a delicious sensation\u2014was waiting for them on deck. He was\nonly too glad to offer some mangoes to Aouda, who thanked him very\ngracefully for them.\n",
        "466": "At eleven o\u2019clock the \u201cRangoon\u201d rode out of Singapore harbour, and in a\nfew hours the high mountains of Malacca, with their forests, inhabited\nby the most beautifully-furred tigers in the world, were lost to view.\nSingapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of\nHong Kong, which is a little English colony near the Chinese coast.\nPhileas Fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days, so as to be\nin time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of November for\nYokohama, the principal Japanese port.\n",
        "467": "The \u201cRangoon\u201d had a large quota of passengers, many of whom disembarked\nat Singapore, among them a number of Indians, Ceylonese, Chinamen,\nMalays, and Portuguese, mostly second-class travellers.\nThe weather, which had hitherto been fine, changed with the last\nquarter of the moon. The sea rolled heavily, and the wind at intervals\nrose almost to a storm, but happily blew from the south-west, and thus\naided the steamer\u2019s progress. The captain as often as possible put up\n",

Owing to\nthe defective construction of the \u201cRangoon,\u201d however, unusual\nprecautions became necessary in unfavourable weather; but the loss of\ntime which resulted from this cause, while it nearly drove Passepartout\nout of his senses, did not seem to affect his master in the least.\nPassepartout blamed the captain, the engineer, and the crew, and\nconsigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the\npepper grows. Perhaps the thought of the gas, which was remorselessly\n",

The crew of the \u201cTankadere\u201d\n",

        "595": "It would clearly have been to the master\u2019s advantage to carry his\npassengers to Yokohama, since he was paid a certain sum per day; but he\nwould have been rash to attempt such a voyage, and it was imprudent\neven to attempt to reach Shanghai. But John Bunsby believed in the\n\u201cTankadere,\u201d which rode on the waves like a seagull; and perhaps he was\nnot wrong.\nLate in the day they passed through the capricious channels of Hong\nKong, and the \u201cTankadere,\u201d impelled by favourable winds, conducted\nherself admirably.\n",

He kept apart\nfrom his fellow-travellers, knowing Mr. Fogg\u2019s taciturn tastes;\n",
        "601": "besides, he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had\naccepted. He was thinking, too, of the future. It seemed certain that\nFogg would not stop at Yokohama, but would at once take the boat for\nSan Francisco; and the vast extent of America would ensure him impunity\nand safety. Fogg\u2019s plan appeared to him the simplest in the world.\nInstead of sailing directly from England to the United States, like a\ncommon villain, he had traversed three quarters of the globe, so as to\ngain the American continent more surely; and there, after throwing the\npolice off his track, he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune\nstolen from the bank. But, once in the United States, what should he,\n",

It was his duty, and he would fulfil it to the end. At all\nevents, there was one thing to be thankful for; Passepartout was not\nwith his master; and it was above all important, after the confidences\nFix had imparted to him, that the servant should never have speech with\nhis master.\n",
        "603": "Phileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout, who had so strangely\ndisappeared. Looking at the matter from every point of view, it did not\nseem to him impossible that, by some mistake, the man might have\nembarked on the \u201cCarnatic\u201d at the last moment; and this was also\nAouda\u2019s opinion, who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellow\nto whom she owed so much. They might then find him at Yokohama; for, if\nthe \u201cCarnatic\u201d was carrying him thither, it would be easy to ascertain\nif he had been on board.\n",

The \u201cTankadere\u201d bore\nsail admirably, as she drew a great deal of water, and everything was\nprepared for high speed in case of a gale.\nMr. Fogg and Aouda descended into the cabin at midnight, having been\n",

But this did\nnot disconcert the enthusiast, who proceeded with the story of Joseph\nSmith\u2019s bankruptcy in 1837, and how his ruined creditors gave him a\ncoat of tar and feathers; his reappearance some years afterwards, more\nhonourable and honoured than ever, at Independence, Missouri, the chief\nof a flourishing colony of three thousand disciples, and his pursuit\nthence by outraged Gentiles, and retirement into the Far West.\n",

        "834": "Was there any means of detaining Mr. Fogg in the car, to avoid a\nmeeting between him and the colonel? It ought not to be a difficult\ntask, since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious.\n",
        "835": "The detective, at least, seemed to have found a way; for, after a few\nmoments, he said to Mr. Fogg, \u201cThese are long and slow hours, sir, that\nwe are passing on the railway.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Mr. Fogg; \u201cbut they pass.\u201d\n",

        "837": "\u201cOh, but we can easily buy some cards, for they are sold on all the\nAmerican trains. And as for partners, if madam plays\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, sir,\u201d Aouda quickly replied; \u201cI understand whist. It is\npart of an English education.\u201d\n",

Well, here are\nthree of us, and a dummy\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAs you please, sir,\u201d replied Phileas Fogg, heartily glad to resume his\nfavourite pastime even on the railway.\nPassepartout was dispatched in search of the steward, and soon returned\nwith two packs of cards, some pins, counters, and a shelf covered with\ncloth.\n",
        "839": "The game commenced. Aouda understood whist sufficiently well, and even\nreceived some compliments on her playing from Mr. Fogg. As for the\ndetective, he was simply an adept, and worthy of being matched against\nhis present opponent.\n",

        "850": "Passepartout, not daring to apprise his master of what he heard,\nlistened with set teeth, immovable as a statue.\n\u201cHum!\u201d cried Colonel Proctor; \u201cbut we are not going to stay here, I\nimagine, and take root in the snow?\u201d\n",

It is a rapid,\nand we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a\nford.\u201d\nThe colonel launched a volley of oaths, denouncing the railway company\nand the conductor; and Passepartout, who was furious, was not\ndisinclined to make common cause with him. Here was an obstacle,\n",
        "854": "indeed, which all his master\u2019s banknotes could not remove.\nThere was a general disappointment among the passengers, who, without\nreckoning the delay, saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles\nover a plain covered with snow. They grumbled and protested, and would\ncertainly have thus attracted Phileas Fogg\u2019s attention if he had not\nbeen completely absorbed in his game.\n",
        "855": "Passepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master what had\noccurred, and, with hanging head, he was turning towards the car, when\nthe engineer, a true Yankee, named Forster called out, \u201cGentlemen,\nperhaps there is a way, after all, to get over.\u201d\n\u201cOn the bridge?\u201d asked a passenger.\n\u201cOn the bridge.\u201d\n",

        "858": "But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer\u2019s\nproposal, and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted, and found the\nplan a very feasible one. He told stories about engineers leaping their\ntrains over rivers without bridges, by putting on full steam; and many\nof those present avowed themselves of the engineer\u2019s mind.\n\u201cWe have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over,\u201d said one.\n",

        "864": "But no one heard this sage reflection, nor would anyone have\nacknowledged its justice. The passengers resumed their places in the\ncars. Passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed. The\nwhist-players were quite absorbed in their game.\n",
        "865": "The locomotive whistled vigorously; the engineer, reversing the steam,\nbacked the train for nearly a mile\u2014retiring, like a jumper, in order to\ntake a longer leap. Then, with another whistle, he began to move\nforward; the train increased its speed, and soon its rapidity became\nfrightful; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive; the piston\nworked up and down twenty strokes to the second. They perceived that\nthe whole train, rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour,\nhardly bore upon the rails at all.\n",
        "866": "And they passed over! It was like a flash. No one saw the bridge. The\ntrain leaped, so to speak, from one bank to the other, and the engineer\ncould not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond the station. But\nscarcely had the train passed the river, when the bridge, completely\nruined, fell with a crash into the rapids of Medicine Bow.\n",

Phileas Fogg was not as yet\nbehind-hand.\nDuring the night Camp Walbach was passed on the left; Lodge Pole Creek\nran parallel with the road, marking the boundary between the\nterritories of Wyoming and Colorado. They entered Nebraska at eleven,\n",

Two powerful\nlocomotives, carrying nine cars of invited guests, amongst whom was\nThomas C. Durant, vice-president of the road, stopped at this point;\n",
        "871": "cheers were given, the Sioux and Pawnees performed an imitation Indian\nbattle, fireworks were let off, and the first number of the _Railway\nPioneer_ was printed by a press brought on the train. Thus was\ncelebrated the inauguration of this great railroad, a mighty instrument\nof progress and civilisation, thrown across the desert, and destined to\nlink together cities and towns which do not yet exist. The whistle of\nthe locomotive, more powerful than Amphion\u2019s lyre, was about to bid\nthem rise from American soil.\n",
        "872": "Fort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning, and three\nhundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching\nOmaha. The road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch\nof the Platte River, on its left bank. At nine the train stopped at the\nimportant town of North Platte, built between the two arms of the\nriver, which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery, a\nlarge tributary, whose waters empty into the Missouri a little above\nOmaha.\n",
        "873": "The one hundred and first meridian was passed.\nMr. Fogg and his partners had resumed their game; no one\u2014not even the\ndummy\u2014complained of the length of the trip. Fix had begun by winning\n",

        "1024": "Captain Speedy, he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key, and was\nuttering loud cries, which signified an anger at once pardonable and\nexcessive.\nWhat had happened was very simple.

        "1025": "had taken passage for Bordeaux, and, during the thirty hours he had\nbeen on board, had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the\nsailors and stokers, who were only an occasional crew, and were not on\nthe best terms with the captain, went over to him in a body. This was\nwhy Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why the\ncaptain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why, in short, the \u201cHenrietta\u201d\nwas directing her course towards Liverpool. It was very clear, to see\nMr. Fogg manage the craft, that he had been a sailor.\n",
        "1026": "How the adventure ended will be seen anon. Aouda was anxious, though\nshe said nothing. As for Passepartout, he thought Mr. Fogg\u2019s man\u0153uvre\nsimply glorious. The captain had said \u201cbetween eleven and twelve\n",

It is true that, once\narrived, the affair on board the \u201cHenrietta,\u201d added to that of the Bank\nof England, might create more difficulties for Mr. Fogg than he\n",
        "1028": "imagined or could desire.\nDuring the first days, they went along smoothly enough. The sea was not\nvery unpropitious, the wind seemed stationary in the north-east, the\nsails were hoisted, and the \u201cHenrietta\u201d ploughed across the waves like\na real transatlantic steamer.\n",
        "1029": "Passepartout was delighted. His master\u2019s last exploit, the consequences\nof which he ignored, enchanted him. Never had the crew seen so jolly\nand dexterous a fellow. He formed warm friendships with the sailors,\n",
        "1030": "and amazed them with his acrobatic feats. He thought they managed the\nvessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers fired up like heroes. His\nloquacious good-humour infected everyone. He had forgotten the past,\n",

        "1032": "Fix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going on. The\nconquest of the \u201cHenrietta,\u201d the bribery of the crew, Fogg managing the\nboat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him. He did not know\nwhat to think. For, after all, a man who began by stealing fifty-five\n",

The conjecture was at least a plausible one, and the\ndetective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair.\nAs for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; and\nPassepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals, courageous as\nhe was, took the greatest precautions. Mr. Fogg did not seem even to\n",
        "1034": "know that there was a captain on board.\nOn the 13th they passed the edge of the Banks of Newfoundland, a\ndangerous locality; during the winter, especially, there are frequent\nfogs and heavy gales of wind.

        "1035": "This was a misfortune. Mr. Fogg, in order not to deviate from his\ncourse, furled his sails and increased the force of the steam; but the\nvessel\u2019s speed slackened, owing to the state of the sea, the long waves\nof which broke against the stern.

        "1039": "well-nigh certain. In winter, they were at the mercy of the bad season.\nPassepartout said nothing; but he cherished hope in secret, and\ncomforted himself with the reflection that, if the wind failed them,\nthey might still count on the steam.\nOn this day the engineer came on deck, went up to Mr. Fogg, and began\n",
        "1040": "to speak earnestly with him. Without knowing why it was a presentiment,\nperhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy. He would have given one of\nhis ears to hear with the other what the engineer was saying. He\n",

        "1045": "Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet, the\nreason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend; but he\nreflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed\nand humiliated in his self-esteem, after having so awkwardly followed a\nfalse scent around the world, and refrained.\nAnd now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt? It was difficult to\nimagine. Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one, for that\n",
        "1046": "evening he sent for the engineer, and said to him, \u201cFeed all the fires\nuntil the coal is exhausted.\u201d\nA few moments after, the funnel of the \u201cHenrietta\u201d vomited forth\ntorrents of smoke. The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on;\nbut on the 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the\ncoal would give out in the course of the day.\n",

        "1049": "point of bursting. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d were the first words his anger\npermitted him to utter. Had the poor man been an apoplectic, he could\nnever have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath.\n",
        "1050": "\u201cWhere are we?\u201d he repeated, with purple face.\n\u201cSeven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool,\u201d replied Mr. Fogg, with\nimperturbable calmness.\n",

        "1145": "Then there was a moment of silence. The great saloon was perfectly\nquiet; but the murmurs of the crowd outside were heard, with now and\nthen a shrill cry. The pendulum beat the seconds, which each player\neagerly counted, as he listened, with mathematical regularity.\n",

        "1150": "Passepartout went on his errand enchanted. He soon reached the\nclergyman\u2019s house, but found him not at home. Passepartout waited a\ngood twenty minutes, and when he left the reverend gentleman, it was\nthirty-five minutes past eight. But in what a state he was! With his\n",
        "1151": "hair in disorder, and without his hat, he ran along the street as never\nman was seen to run before, overturning passers-by, rushing over the\nsidewalk like a waterspout.\nIn three minutes he was in Saville Row again, and staggered back into\nMr. Fogg\u2019s room.\nHe could not speak.\n",
        "1152": "\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d asked Mr. Fogg.\n\u201cMy master!\u201d gasped Passepartout\u2014\u201cmarriage\u2014impossible\u2014\u201d\n\u201cImpossible?\u201d\n",

        "1154": "\u201cMonday,\u201d replied Mr. Fogg.\n\u201cNo\u2014to-day is Saturday.\u201d\n\u201cSaturday? Impossible!\u201d\n",
        "1155": "\u201cYes, yes, yes, yes!\u201d cried Passepartout. \u201cYou have made a mistake of\none day! We arrived twenty-four hours ahead of time; but there are only\nten minutes left!\u201d\n",
        "1156": "Passepartout had seized his master by the collar, and was dragging him\nalong with irresistible force.\nPhileas Fogg, thus kidnapped, without having time to think, left his\nhouse, jumped into a cab, promised a hundred pounds to the cabman, and,\nhaving run over two dogs and overturned five carriages, reached the\nReform Club.\nThe clock indicated a quarter before nine when he appeared in the great\nsaloon.\n",
        "1157": "Phileas Fogg had accomplished the journey round the world in eighty\ndays!\nPhileas Fogg had won his wager of twenty thousand pounds!\nHow was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made this\nerror of a day? How came he to think that he had arrived in London on\n",
        "1158": "Saturday, the twenty-first day of December, when it was really Friday,\nthe twentieth, the seventy-ninth day only from his departure?\nThe cause of the error is very simple.\nPhileas Fogg had, without suspecting it, gained one day on his journey,\nand this merely because he had travelled constantly _eastward;_ he\nwould, on the contrary, have lost a day had he gone in the opposite\ndirection, that is, _westward_.\n",
        "1159": "In journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun, and the days\ntherefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed\ndegrees in this direction. There are three hundred and sixty degrees on\nthe circumference of the earth; and these three hundred and sixty\ndegrees, multiplied by four minutes, gives precisely twenty-four\nhours\u2014that is, the day unconsciously gained. In other words, while\nPhileas Fogg, going eastward, saw the sun pass the meridian _eighty_\ntimes, his friends in London only saw it pass the meridian\n_seventy-nine_ times. This is why they awaited him at the Reform Club\n",
        "1160": "on Saturday, and not Sunday, as Mr. Fogg thought.\nAnd Passepartout\u2019s famous family watch, which had always kept London\ntime, would have betrayed this fact, if it had marked the days as well\nas the hours and the minutes!\nPhileas Fogg, then, had won the twenty thousand pounds; but, as he had\nspent nearly nineteen thousand on the way, the pecuniary gain was\nsmall. His object was, however, to be victorious, and not to win money.\n",
        "1161": "He divided the one thousand pounds that remained between Passepartout\nand the unfortunate Fix, against whom he cherished no grudge. He\ndeducted, however, from Passepartout\u2019s share the cost of the gas which\nhad burned in his room for nineteen hundred and twenty hours, for the\nsake of regularity.\nThat evening, Mr. Fogg, as tranquil and phlegmatic as ever, said to\n",

        "1164": "It need not be said that the marriage took place forty-eight hours\nafter, and that Passepartout, glowing and dazzling, gave the bride\naway. Had he not saved her, and was he not entitled to this honour?\nThe next day, as soon as it was light, Passepartout rapped vigorously\nat his master\u2019s door. Mr. Fogg opened it, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the\nmatter, Passepartout?\u201d\n",
