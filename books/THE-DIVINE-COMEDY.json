        "4": ".\n.\nHELL\nOR THE INFERNO\nCANTO I\nIn the midway of this our mortal life,\nI found me in a gloomy wood, astray\nGone from the path direct: and e\u2019en to tell\nIt were no easy task, how savage wild\nThat forest, how robust and rough its growth,\nWhich to remember only, my dismay\nRenews, in bitterness not far from death.\n",
        "5": "Yet to discourse of what there good befell,\nAll else will I relate discover\u2019d there.\nHow first I enter\u2019d it I scarce can say,\nSuch sleepy dullness in that instant weigh\u2019d\nMy senses down, when the true path I left,\nBut when a mountain\u2019s foot I reach\u2019d, where clos\u2019d\nThe valley, that had pierc\u2019d my heart with dread,\nI look\u2019d aloft, and saw his shoulders broad\nAlready vested with that planet\u2019s beam,\nWho leads all wanderers safe through every way.\nThen was a little respite to the fear,\nThat in my heart\u2019s recesses deep had lain,\nAll of that night, so pitifully pass\u2019d:\nAnd as a man, with difficult short breath,\nForespent with toiling, \u2019scap\u2019d from sea to shore,\nTurns to the perilous wide waste, and stands\nAt gaze; e\u2019en so my spirit, that yet fail\u2019d\nStruggling with terror, turn\u2019d to view the straits,\nThat none hath pass\u2019d and liv\u2019d. My weary frame\n",
        "6": "After short pause recomforted, again\nI journey\u2019d on over that lonely steep,\nThe hinder foot still firmer. Scarce the ascent\nBegan, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,\nAnd cover\u2019d with a speckled skin, appear\u2019d,\nNor, when it saw me, vanish\u2019d, rather strove\nTo check my onward going; that ofttimes\nWith purpose to retrace my steps I turn\u2019d.\n",
        "7": "The hour was morning\u2019s prime, and on his way\nAloft the sun ascended with those stars,\nThat with him rose, when Love divine first mov\u2019d\nThose its fair works: so that with joyous hope\nAll things conspir\u2019d to fill me, the gay skin\nOf that swift animal, the matin dawn\nAnd the sweet season. Soon that joy was chas\u2019d,\nAnd by new dread succeeded, when in view\nA lion came, \u2019gainst me, as it appear\u2019d,\nWith his head held aloft and hunger-mad,\nThat e\u2019en the air was fear-struck. A she-wolf\nWas at his heels, who in her leanness seem\u2019d\nFull of all wants, and many a land hath made\nDisconsolate ere now. She with such fear\n",
        "8": "O\u2019erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall\u2019d,\nThat of the height all hope I lost. As one,\nWho with his gain elated, sees the time\nWhen all unwares is gone, he inwardly\nMourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,\nHaunted by that fell beast, never at peace,\nWho coming o\u2019er against me, by degrees\nImpell\u2019d me where the sun in silence rests.\nWhile to the lower space with backward step\nI fell, my ken discern\u2019d the form one of one,\nWhose voice seem\u2019d faint through long disuse of speech.\n",
        "9": "When him in that great desert I espied,\n\u201cHave mercy on me!\u201d cried I out aloud,\n\u201cSpirit! or living man! what e\u2019er thou be!\u201d\nHe answer\u2019d: \u201cNow not man, man once I was,\nAnd born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both\nBy country, when the power of Julius yet\nWas scarcely firm. At Rome my life was past\n",
        "10": "Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time\nOf fabled deities and false. A bard\nWas I, and made Anchises\u2019 upright son\nThe subject of my song, who came from Troy,\nWhen the flames prey\u2019d on Ilium\u2019s haughty towers.\nBut thou, say wherefore to such perils past\nReturn\u2019st thou? wherefore not this pleasant mount\n",
        "11": "Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?\u201d\n\u201cAnd art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,\nFrom which such copious floods of eloquence\nHave issued?\u201d I with front abash\u2019d replied.\n\u201cGlory and light of all the tuneful train!\n",
        "12": "May it avail me that I long with zeal\nHave sought thy volume, and with love immense\nHave conn\u2019d it o\u2019er. My master thou and guide!\nThou he from whom alone I have deriv\u2019d\nThat style, which for its beauty into fame\nExalts me. See the beast, from whom I fled.\nO save me from her, thou illustrious sage!\n",
        "13": "\u201cFor every vein and pulse throughout my frame\nShe hath made tremble.\u201d He, soon as he saw\nThat I was weeping, answer\u2019d, \u201cThou must needs\nAnother way pursue, if thou wouldst \u2019scape\nFrom out that savage wilderness. This beast,\nAt whom thou criest, her way will suffer none\nTo pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:\nSo bad and so accursed in her kind,\nThat never sated is her ravenous will,\nStill after food more craving than before.\n",
        "14": "To many an animal in wedlock vile\nShe fastens, and shall yet to many more,\nUntil that greyhound come, who shall destroy\nHer with sharp pain. He will not life support\nBy earth nor its base metals, but by love,\nWisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be\nThe land \u2019twixt either Feltro. In his might\nShall safety to Italia\u2019s plains arise,\nFor whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,\nNisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.\n",
        "15": "He with incessant chase through every town\nShall worry, until he to hell at length\nRestore her, thence by envy first let loose.\nI for thy profit pond\u2019ring now devise,\nThat thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide\nWill lead thee hence through an eternal space,\nWhere thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see\nSpirits of old tormented, who invoke\nA second death; and those next view, who dwell\nContent in fire, for that they hope to come,\nWhene\u2019er the time may be, among the blest,\nInto whose regions if thou then desire\nT\u2019 ascend, a spirit worthier than I\nMust lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,\nThou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,\nWho reigns above, a rebel to his law,\nAdjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,\nThat to his city none through me should come.\nHe in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds\nHis citadel and throne. O happy those,\n",
        "16": "Whom there he chooses!\u201d I to him in few:\n\u201cBard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,\nI do beseech thee (that this ill and worse\nI may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,\nThat I Saint Peter\u2019s gate may view, and those\nWho as thou tell\u2019st, are in such dismal plight.\u201d\n",
        "17": "Onward he mov\u2019d, I close his steps pursu\u2019d.\nCANTO II\nNow was the day departing, and the air,\nImbrown\u2019d with shadows, from their toils releas\u2019d\nAll animals on earth; and I alone\nPrepar\u2019d myself the conflict to sustain,\nBoth of sad pity, and that perilous road,\nWhich my unerring memory shall retrace.\nO Muses! O high genius! now vouchsafe\n",
        "18": "Your aid! O mind! that all I saw hast kept\nSafe in a written record, here thy worth\nAnd eminent endowments come to proof.\nI thus began: \u201cBard! thou who art my guide,\n",
        "19": "Consider well, if virtue be in me\nSufficient, ere to this high enterprise\nThou trust me. Thou hast told that Silvius\u2019 sire,\nYet cloth\u2019d in corruptible flesh, among\nTh\u2019 immortal tribes had entrance, and was there\nSensible present. Yet if heaven\u2019s great Lord,\nAlmighty foe to ill, such favour shew\u2019d,\nIn contemplation of the high effect,\nBoth what and who from him should issue forth,\nIt seems in reason\u2019s judgment well deserv\u2019d:\nSith he of Rome, and of Rome\u2019s empire wide,\nIn heaven\u2019s empyreal height was chosen sire:\nBoth which, if truth be spoken, were ordain\u2019d\nAnd \u2019stablish\u2019d for the holy place, where sits\nWho to great Peter\u2019s sacred chair succeeds.\n",
        "20": "He from this journey, in thy song renown\u2019d,\nLearn\u2019d things, that to his victory gave rise\nAnd to the papal robe. In after-times\nThe chosen vessel also travel\u2019d there,\nTo bring us back assurance in that faith,\nWhich is the entrance to salvation\u2019s way.\nBut I, why should I there presume? or who\n",
        "21": "Permits it? not Aeneas I nor Paul.\nMyself I deem not worthy, and none else\nWill deem me. I, if on this voyage then\nI venture, fear it will in folly end.\n",
        "22": "Thou, who art wise, better my meaning know\u2019st,\nThan I can speak.\u201d As one, who unresolves\nWhat he hath late resolv\u2019d, and with new thoughts\nChanges his purpose, from his first intent\nRemov\u2019d; e\u2019en such was I on that dun coast,\nWasting in thought my enterprise, at first\nSo eagerly embrac\u2019d. \u201cIf right thy words\nI scan,\u201d replied that shade magnanimous,\n\u201cThy soul is by vile fear assail\u2019d, which oft\nSo overcasts a man, that he recoils\nFrom noblest resolution, like a beast\nAt some false semblance in the twilight gloom.\n",
        "23": "That from this terror thou mayst free thyself,\nI will instruct thee why I came, and what\nI heard in that same instant, when for thee\nGrief touch\u2019d me first. I was among the tribe,\nWho rest suspended, when a dame, so blest\nAnd lovely, I besought her to command,\nCall\u2019d me; her eyes were brighter than the star\nOf day; and she with gentle voice and soft\nAngelically tun\u2019d her speech address\u2019d:\n\u201cO courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame\nYet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!\n",
        "24": "A friend, not of my fortune but myself,\nOn the wide desert in his road has met\nHindrance so great, that he through fear has turn\u2019d.\nNow much I dread lest he past help have stray\u2019d,\nAnd I be ris\u2019n too late for his relief,\nFrom what in heaven of him I heard. Speed now,\nAnd by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,\nAnd by all means for his deliverance meet,\nAssist him. So to me will comfort spring.\n",
        "25": "I who now bid thee on this errand forth\nAm Beatrice; from a place I come.\n(Note: Beatrice. I use this word, as it is\npronounced in the Italian, as consisting of four\nsyllables, of which the third is a long one.) Revisited with joy. Love\n",
        "26": "brought me thence,\nWho prompts my speech. When in my Master\u2019s sight\nI stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell.\u201d\nShe then was silent, and I thus began:\n\u201cO Lady! by whose influence alone,\n",
        "27": "Mankind excels whatever is contain\u2019d\nWithin that heaven which hath the smallest orb,\nSo thy command delights me, that to obey,\nIf it were done already, would seem late.\nNo need hast thou farther to speak thy will;\nYet tell the reason, why thou art not loth\nTo leave that ample space, where to return\nThou burnest, for this centre here beneath.\u201d\nShe then: \u201cSince thou so deeply wouldst inquire,\nI will instruct thee briefly, why no dread\nHinders my entrance here. Those things alone\n",
        "28": "Are to be fear\u2019d, whence evil may proceed,\nNone else, for none are terrible beside.\nI am so fram\u2019d by God, thanks to his grace!\nThat any suff\u2019rance of your misery\nTouches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire\nAssails me. In high heaven a blessed dame\n",
        "29": "Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief\nThat hindrance, which I send thee to remove,\nThat God\u2019s stern judgment to her will inclines.\u201d\nTo Lucia calling, her she thus bespake:\n\u201cNow doth thy faithful servant need thy aid\nAnd I commend him to thee.\u201d At her word\nSped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe,\nAnd coming to the place, where I abode\nSeated with Rachel, her of ancient days,\nShe thus address\u2019d me: \u201cThou true praise of God!\n",
        "30": "Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent\nTo him, who so much lov\u2019d thee, as to leave\nFor thy sake all the multitude admires?\nDost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,\nNor mark the death, which in the torrent flood,\nSwoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?\u201d\n",
        "31": "Ne\u2019er among men did any with such speed\nHaste to their profit, flee from their annoy,\nAs when these words were spoken, I came here,\nDown from my blessed seat, trusting the force\nOf thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all\nWho well have mark\u2019d it, into honour brings.\u201d\n\u201cWhen she had ended, her bright beaming eyes\nTearful she turn\u2019d aside; whereat I felt\nRedoubled zeal to serve thee. As she will\u2019d,\nThus am I come: I sav\u2019d thee from the beast,\nWho thy near way across the goodly mount\nPrevented. What is this comes o\u2019er thee then?\n",
        "32": "Why, why dost thou hang back? why in thy breast\nHarbour vile fear? why hast not courage there\nAnd noble daring? Since three maids so blest\n",
        "33": "Thy safety plan, e\u2019en in the court of heaven;\nAnd so much certain good my words forebode.\u201d\nAs florets, by the frosty air of night\nBent down and clos\u2019d, when day has blanch\u2019d their leaves,\nRise all unfolded on their spiry stems;\nSo was my fainting vigour new restor\u2019d,\nAnd to my heart such kindly courage ran,\nThat I as one undaunted soon replied:\n\u201cO full of pity she, who undertook\nMy succour! and thou kind who didst perform\nSo soon her true behest! With such desire\n",
        "34": "Thou hast dispos\u2019d me to renew my voyage,\nThat my first purpose fully is resum\u2019d.\nLead on: one only will is in us both.\nThou art my guide, my master thou, and lord.\u201d\n",
        "35": "So spake I; and when he had onward mov\u2019d,\nI enter\u2019d on the deep and woody way.\nCANTO III\n\u201cThrough me you pass into the city of woe:\nThrough me you pass into eternal pain:\nThrough me among the people lost for aye.\nJustice the founder of my fabric mov\u2019d:\nTo rear me was the task of power divine,\nSupremest wisdom, and primeval love.\n",
        "36": "Before me things create were none, save things\nEternal, and eternal I endure.\n\u201cAll hope abandon ye who enter here.\u201d\nSuch characters in colour dim I mark\u2019d\nOver a portal\u2019s lofty arch inscrib\u2019d:\nWhereat I thus: \u201cMaster, these words import\nHard meaning.\u201d He as one prepar\u2019d replied:\n",
        "37": "\u201cHere thou must all distrust behind thee leave;\nHere be vile fear extinguish\u2019d. We are come\nWhere I have told thee we shall see the souls\nTo misery doom\u2019d, who intellectual good\nHave lost.\u201d And when his hand he had stretch\u2019d forth\nTo mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer\u2019d,\nInto that secret place he led me on.\n",
        "38": "Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans\nResounded through the air pierc\u2019d by no star,\nThat e\u2019en I wept at entering. Various tongues,\nHorrible languages, outcries of woe,\nAccents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,\nWith hands together smote that swell\u2019d the sounds,\nMade up a tumult, that for ever whirls\nRound through that air with solid darkness stain\u2019d,\nLike to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.\nI then, with error yet encompass\u2019d, cried:\n\u201cO master! What is this I hear? What race\n",
        "39": "Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?\u201d\nHe thus to me: \u201cThis miserable fate\nSuffer the wretched souls of those, who liv\u2019d\nWithout or praise or blame, with that ill band\nOf angels mix\u2019d, who nor rebellious prov\u2019d\nNor yet were true to God, but for themselves\nWere only. From his bounds Heaven drove them forth,\nNot to impair his lustre, nor the depth\nOf Hell receives them, lest th\u2019 accursed tribe\nShould glory thence with exultation vain.\u201d\n",
        "40": "I then: \u201cMaster! what doth aggrieve them thus,\nThat they lament so loud?\u201d He straight replied:\n\u201cThat will I tell thee briefly. These of death\n",
        "41": "No hope may entertain: and their blind life\nSo meanly passes, that all other lots\nThey envy. Fame of them the world hath none,\nNor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both.\nSpeak not of them, but look, and pass them by.\u201d\n",
        "42": "And I, who straightway look\u2019d, beheld a flag,\nWhich whirling ran around so rapidly,\nThat it no pause obtain\u2019d: and following came\nSuch a long train of spirits, I should ne\u2019er\nHave thought, that death so many had despoil\u2019d.\nWhen some of these I recogniz\u2019d, I saw\nAnd knew the shade of him, who to base fear\nYielding, abjur\u2019d his high estate. Forthwith\nI understood for certain this the tribe\nOf those ill spirits both to God displeasing\nAnd to his foes. These wretches, who ne\u2019er lived,\n",
        "43": "Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung\nBy wasps and hornets, which bedew\u2019d their cheeks\nWith blood, that mix\u2019d with tears dropp\u2019d to their feet,\nAnd by disgustful worms was gather\u2019d there.\nThen looking farther onwards I beheld\nA throng upon the shore of a great stream:\nWhereat I thus: \u201cSir! grant me now to know\nWhom here we view, and whence impell\u2019d they seem\nSo eager to pass o\u2019er, as I discern\nThrough the blear light?\u201d He thus to me in few:\n",
        "44": "\u201cThis shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive\nBeside the woeful tide of Acheron.\u201d\nThen with eyes downward cast and fill\u2019d with shame,\nFearing my words offensive to his ear,\nTill we had reach\u2019d the river, I from speech\nAbstain\u2019d. And lo! toward us in a bark\nComes on an old man hoary white with eld,\nCrying, \u201cWoe to you wicked spirits! hope not\n",
        "45": "Ever to see the sky again. I come\nTo take you to the other shore across,\nInto eternal darkness, there to dwell\nIn fierce heat and in ice. And thou, who there\nStandest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave\n",
        "46": "These who are dead.\u201d But soon as he beheld\nI left them not, \u201cBy other way,\u201d said he,\n\u201cBy other haven shalt thou come to shore,\nNot by this passage; thee a nimbler boat\nMust carry.\u201d Then to him thus spake my guide:\n\u201cCharon! thyself torment not: so \u2019t is will\u2019d,\n",
        "47": "Where will and power are one: ask thou no more.\u201d\nStraightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks\nOf him the boatman o\u2019er the livid lake,\nAround whose eyes glar\u2019d wheeling flames. Meanwhile\nThose spirits, faint and naked, color chang\u2019d,\nAnd gnash\u2019d their teeth, soon as the cruel words\nThey heard. God and their parents they blasphem\u2019d,\n",
        "48": "The human kind, the place, the time, and seed\nThat did engender them and give them birth.\nThen all together sorely wailing drew\nTo the curs\u2019d strand, that every man must pass\nWho fears not God. Charon, demoniac form,\nWith eyes of burning coal, collects them all,\nBeck\u2019ning, and each, that lingers, with his oar\nStrikes. As fall off the light autumnal leaves,\n",
        "49": "One still another following, till the bough\nStrews all its honours on the earth beneath;\nE\u2019en in like manner Adam\u2019s evil brood\nCast themselves one by one down from the shore,\nEach at a beck, as falcon at his call.\nThus go they over through the umber\u2019d wave,\nAnd ever they on the opposing bank\nBe landed, on this side another throng\nStill gathers. \u201cSon,\u201d thus spake the courteous guide,\n\u201cThose, who die subject to the wrath of God,\nAll here together come from every clime,\nAnd to o\u2019erpass the river are not loth:\nFor so heaven\u2019s justice goads them on, that fear\nIs turn\u2019d into desire. Hence ne\u2019er hath past\n",
        "50": "Good spirit. If of thee Charon complain,\nNow mayst thou know the import of his words.\u201d\nThis said, the gloomy region trembling shook\nSo terribly, that yet with clammy dews\nFear chills my brow. The sad earth gave a blast,\n",
        "51": "That, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame,\nWhich all my senses conquer\u2019d quite, and I\nDown dropp\u2019d, as one with sudden slumber seiz\u2019d.\nCANTO IV\nBroke the deep slumber in my brain a crash\nOf heavy thunder, that I shook myself,\nAs one by main force rous\u2019d. Risen upright,\nMy rested eyes I mov\u2019d around, and search\u2019d\nWith fixed ken to know what place it was,\nWherein I stood. For certain on the brink\n",
        "52": "I found me of the lamentable vale,\nThe dread abyss, that joins a thund\u2019rous sound\nOf plaints innumerable. Dark and deep,\nAnd thick with clouds o\u2019erspread, mine eye in vain\nExplor\u2019d its bottom, nor could aught discern.\n\u201cNow let us to the blind world there beneath\nDescend;\u201d the bard began all pale of look:\n\u201cI go the first, and thou shalt follow next.\u201d\n",
        "53": "Then I his alter\u2019d hue perceiving, thus:\n\u201cHow may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,\nWho still art wont to comfort me in doubt?\u201d\nHe then: \u201cThe anguish of that race below\nWith pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear\nMistakest. Let us on. Our length of way\nUrges to haste.\u201d Onward, this said, he mov\u2019d;\n",
