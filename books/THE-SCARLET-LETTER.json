The first time was\nthree or four years since, when I favored the reader\u2014inexcusably, and\nfor no earthly reason, that either the indulgent reader or the\nintrusive author could imagine\u2014with a description of my way of life\nin the deep quietude of an Old Manse.

Some authors,\n",

It is scarcely decorous, however, to speak all, even where we\nspeak impersonally. But, as thoughts are frozen and utterance\nbenumbed, unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his\naudience, it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend, a kind and\napprehensive, though not the closest friend, is listening to our talk;\nand then, a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness,\nwe may prate of the circumstances that lie around us, and even of\nourself, but still keep the inmost Me behind its veil. To this extent,\n",

From the loftiest point of its roof, during\nprecisely three and a half hours of each forenoon, floats or droops,\nin breeze or calm, the banner of the republic; but with the thirteen\nstripes turned vertically, instead of horizontally, and thus\nindicating that a civil, and not a military post of Uncle Sam\u2019s\ngovernment is here established. Its front is ornamented with a portico\n",
        "24": "of half a dozen wooden pillars, supporting a balcony, beneath which a\nflight of wide granite steps descends towards the street. Over the\nentrance hovers an enormous specimen of the American eagle, with\noutspread wings, a shield before her breast, and, if I recollect\naright, a bunch of intermingled thunderbolts and barbed arrows in each\nclaw. With the customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this\nunhappy fowl, she appears, by the fierceness of her beak and eye, and\nthe general truculency of her attitude, to threaten mischief to the\ninoffensive community; and especially to warn all citizens, careful of\ntheir safety, against intruding on the premises which she overshadows\nwith her wings. Nevertheless, vixenly as she looks, many people are\n",
        "25": "seeking, at this very moment, to shelter themselves under the wing of\nthe federal eagle; imagining, I presume, that her bosom has all the\nsoftness and snugness of an eider-down pillow. But she has no great\ntenderness, even in her best of moods, and, sooner or later,\u2014oftener\nsoon than late,\u2014is apt to fling off her nestlings, with a scratch of\nher claw, a dab of her beak, or a rankling wound from her barbed\narrows.\nThe pavement round about the above-described edifice\u2014which we may as\nwell name at once as the Custom-House of the port\u2014has grass enough\ngrowing in its chinks to show that it has not, of late days, been worn\nby any multitudinous resort of business. In some months of the year,\n",

Such occasions might remind the elderly citizen of\nthat period before the last war with England, when Salem was a port by\nitself; not scorned, as she is now, by her own merchants and\nship-owners, who permit her wharves to crumble to ruin, while their\nventures go to swell, needlessly and imperceptibly, the mighty flood\nof commerce at New York or Boston. On some such morning, when three or\nfour vessels happen to have arrived at once,\u2014usually from Africa or\nSouth America,\u2014or to be on the verge of their departure thitherward,\nthere is a sound of frequent feet, passing briskly up and down the\ngranite steps.

Oftentimes they were asleep, but occasionally might\nbe heard talking together, in voices between speech and a snore, and\nwith that lack of energy that distinguishes the occupants of\nalmshouses, and all other human beings who depend for subsistence on\ncharity, on monopolized labor, or anything else, but their own\nindependent exertions. These old gentlemen\u2014seated, like Matthew, at\nthe receipt of customs, but not very liable to be summoned thence,\nlike him, for apostolic errands\u2014were Custom-House officers.\n",

All three give glimpses of\nthe shops of grocers, block-makers, slop-sellers, and ship-chandlers;\naround the doors of which are generally to be seen, laughing and\ngossiping, clusters of old salts, and such other wharf-rats as haunt\nthe Wapping of a seaport. The room itself is cobwebbed, and dingy with\nold paint; its floor is strewn with gray sand, in a fashion that has\nelsewhere fallen into long disuse; and it is easy to conclude, from\nthe general slovenliness of the place, that this is a sanctuary into\nwhich womankind, with her tools of magic, the broom and mop, has very\ninfrequent access.

A tin pipe ascends through the ceiling, and forms a\nmedium of vocal communication with other parts of the edifice. And\nhere, some six months ago,\u2014pacing from corner to corner, or lounging\non the long-legged stool, with his elbow on the desk, and his eyes\nwandering up and down the columns of the morning newspaper,\u2014you might\nhave recognized, honored reader, the same individual who welcomed you\ninto his cheery little study, where the sunshine glimmered so\npleasantly through the willow branches, on the western side of the Old\nManse.

Luther, according to the scandal of his monkish\nenemies, was a brat of that hellish breed; nor was Pearl the only\nchild to whom this inauspicious origin was assigned, among the New\nEngland Puritans.\n",

On the supposition that Pearl, as already hinted, was of demon\norigin, these good people not unreasonably argued that a Christian\ninterest in the mother\u2019s soul required them to remove such a\nstumbling-block from her path.

Among those who promoted the\ndesign, Governor Bellingham was said to be one of the most busy. It\nmay appear singular, and indeed, not a little ludicrous, that an\naffair of this kind, which, in later days, would have been referred to\nno higher jurisdiction than that of the selectmen of the town, should\nthen have been a question publicly discussed, and on which statesmen\nof eminence took sides. At that epoch of pristine simplicity, however,\n",

There was fire\nin her and throughout her; she seemed the unpremeditated offshoot of a\npassionate moment. Her mother, in contriving the child\u2019s garb, had\nallowed the gorgeous tendencies of her imagination their full play;\narraying her in a crimson velvet tunic, of a peculiar cut, abundantly\nembroidered with fantasies and flourishes of gold-thread.

It was the scarlet letter in another form; the scarlet\nletter endowed with life! The mother herself\u2014as if the red ignominy\n",

But,\nin truth, Pearl was the one, as well as the other; and only in\nconsequence of that identity had Hester contrived so perfectly to\nrepresent the scarlet letter in her appearance.\nAs the two wayfarers came within the precincts of the town, the\nchildren of the Puritans looked up from their play,\u2014or what passed\nfor play with those sombre little urchins,\u2014and spake gravely one to\nanother:\u2014\n\u201cBehold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlet letter; and, of a\ntruth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlet letter running\nalong by her side!

Lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal, Hester Prynne\ngave a summons, which was answered by one of the Governor\u2019s\nbond-servants; a free-born Englishman, but now a seven years\u2019 slave.\n",

On\nthe table\u2014in token that the sentiment of old English hospitality had\nnot been left behind\u2014stood a large pewter tankard, at the bottom of\nwhich, had Hester or Pearl peeped into it, they might have seen the\nfrothy remnant of a recent draught of ale.\n",
        "377": "On the wall hung a row of portraits, representing the forefathers of\nthe Bellingham lineage, some with armor on their breasts, and others\nwith stately ruffs and robes of peace.

For the\nsake of the minister\u2019s health, and to enable the leech to gather\nplants with healing balm in them, they took long walks on the\nsea-shore, or in the forest; mingling various talk with the plash and\nmurmur of the waves, and the solemn wind-anthem among the tree-tops.\n",
        "450": "Often, likewise, one was the guest of the other, in his place of\nstudy and retirement.

Not\nthe less, however, though with a tremulous enjoyment, did he feel the\noccasional relief of looking at the universe through the medium of\nanother kind of intellect than those with which he habitually held\nconverse.

On the other side of the house old Roger\nChillingworth arranged his study and laboratory; not such as a modern\nman of science would reckon even tolerably complete, but provided with\na distilling apparatus, and the means of compounding drugs and\nchemicals, which the practised alchemist knew well how to turn to\npurpose. With such commodiousness of situation, these two learned\npersons sat themselves down, each in his own domain, yet familiarly\npassing from one apartment to the other, and bestowing a mutual and\nnot incurious inspection into one another\u2019s business.\n",

Two or three individuals hinted,\nthat the man of skill, during his Indian captivity, had enlarged his\nmedical attainments by joining in the incantations of the savage\npriests; who were universally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters,\noften performing seemingly miraculous cures by their skill in the\nblack art. A large number\u2014and many of these were persons of such\nsober sense and practical observation that their opinions would have\nbeen valuable, in other matters\u2014affirmed that Roger Chillingworth\u2019s\naspect had undergone a remarkable change while he had dwelt in town,\nand especially since his abode with Mr. Dimmesdale.

And there was\nPearl, too, lightly dancing from the margin of the brook,\u2014now that\nthe intrusive third person was gone,\u2014and taking her old place by her\nmother\u2019s side. So the minister had not fallen asleep and dreamed!\nIn order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicity of\nimpression, which vexed it with a strange disquietude, he recalled and\nmore thoroughly defined the plans which Hester and himself had\nsketched for their departure.

Not to\nspeak of the clergyman\u2019s health, so inadequate to sustain the\nhardships of a forest life, his native gifts, his culture, and his\nentire development, would secure him a home only in the midst of\ncivilization and refinement; the higher the state, the more delicately\nadapted to it the man. In furtherance of this choice, it so happened\nthat a ship lay in the harbor; one of those questionable cruisers,\nfrequent at that day, which, without being absolutely outlaws of the\ndeep, yet roamed over its surface with a remarkable irresponsibility\nof character.

A similar\nimpression struck him most remarkably, as he passed under the walls of\nhis own church. The edifice had so very strange, and yet so familiar,\nan aspect, that Mr. Dimmesdale\u2019s mind vibrated between two ideas;\n",
        "903": "either that he had seen it only in a dream hitherto, or that he was\nmerely dreaming about it now.\nThis phenomenon, in the various shapes which it assumed, indicated no\nexternal change, but so sudden and important a change in the spectator\nof the familiar scene, that the intervening space of a single day had\noperated on his consciousness like the lapse of years. The minister\u2019s\nown will, and Hester\u2019s will, and the fate that grew between them, had\nwrought this transformation. It was the same town as heretofore; but\n",

        "906": "Before Mr. Dimmesdale reached home, his inner man gave him other\nevidences of a revolution in the sphere of thought and feeling.

At every step\n",
        "907": "he was incited to do some strange, wild, wicked thing or other, with a\nsense that it would be at once involuntary and intentional; in spite\nof himself, yet growing out of a profounder self than that which\nopposed the impulse. For instance, he met one of his own deacons. The\ngood old man addressed him with the paternal affection and patriarchal\nprivilege, which his venerable age, his upright and holy character,\nand his station in the Church, entitled him to use; and, conjoined\nwith this, the deep, almost worshipping respect, which the minister\u2019s\nprofessional and private claims alike demanded. Never was there a more\nbeautiful example of how the majesty of age and wisdom may comport\nwith the obeisance and respect enjoined upon it, as from a lower\nsocial rank, and inferior order of endowment, towards a higher.

And, since Mr. Dimmesdale had taken her in charge, the\ngood grandam\u2019s chief earthly comfort\u2014which, unless it had been\nlikewise a heavenly comfort, could have been none at all\u2014was to meet\nher pastor, whether casually, or of set purpose, and be refreshed with\na word of warm, fragrant, heaven-breathing Gospel truth, from his\nbeloved lips, into her dulled, but rapturously attentive ear.

        "913": "Again, a third instance. After parting from the old church-member, he\nmet the youngest sister of them all. It was a maiden newly won\u2014and\nwon by the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale\u2019s own sermon, on the Sabbath after\n",

The minister\nknew well that he was himself enshrined within the stainless sanctity\nof her heart, which hung its snowy curtains about his image, imparting\nto religion the warmth of love, and to love a religious purity. Satan,\n",
        "915": "that afternoon, had surely led the poor young girl away from her\nmother\u2019s side, and thrown her into the pathway of this sorely tempted,\nor\u2014shall we not rather say?\u2014this lost and desperate man. As she drew\nnigh, the arch-fiend whispered him to condense into small compass and\ndrop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would be sure to\nblossom darkly soon, and bear black fruit betimes. Such was his sense\nof power over this virgin soul, trusting him as she did, that the\nminister felt potent to blight all the field of innocence with but one\nwicked look, and develop all its opposite with but a word.

        "916": "mightier struggle than he had yet sustained\u2014he held his Geneva cloak\nbefore his face, and hurried onward, making no sign of recognition,\nand leaving the young sister to digest his rudeness as she might.

        "917": "Before the minister had time to celebrate his victory over this last\ntemptation, he was conscious of another impulse, more ludicrous, and\nalmost as horrible. It was,\u2014we blush to tell it,\u2014it was to stop\nshort in the road, and teach some very wicked words to a knot of\nlittle Puritan children who were playing there, and had but just begun\nto talk. Denying himself this freak, as unworthy of his cloth, he met\na drunken seaman, one of the ship\u2019s crew from the Spanish Main. And,\n",

It was not so much a better\nprinciple as partly his natural good taste, and still more his\nbuckramed habit of clerical decorum, that carried him safely through\nthe latter crisis.\n",
        "919": "\u201cWhat is it that haunts and tempts me thus?\u201d cried the minister to\nhimself, at length, pausing in the street, and striking his hand\nagainst his forehead. \u201cAm I mad? or am I given over utterly to the\nfiend? Did I make a contract with him in the forest, and sign it with\n",

Letters came,\nwith armorial seals upon them, though of bearings unknown to English\nheraldry.
