I had been transacting some business in\nParis and was returning by the morning service to London where I was\nstill sharing rooms with my old friend, the Belgian ex-detective,\nHercule Poirot.\n",
        "6": "The Calais express was singularly empty\u2014in fact, my own compartment\nheld only one other traveller. I had made a somewhat hurried departure\nfrom the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected\nall my traps when the train started. Up till then I had hardly noticed\nmy companion, but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her\nexistence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck\n",
        "7": "her head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible\nejaculation \u201cHell!\u201d\nNow I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly. I have\nno patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to\nnight, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a\nBillingsgate fishwoman blush!\n",
        "8": "I looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face,\nsurmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls\nhid each ear. I judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her\nface was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly\nscarlet.\n",

        "13": "two I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. In spite of\nmyself I could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the\npaper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter.\n\u201cI knew you weren\u2019t such a mutt as you looked,\u201d she cried.\n",
        "14": "Her laughter was so infectious that I could not help joining in, though\nI hardly cared for the word \u201cmutt.\u201d The girl was certainly all that I\nmost disliked, but that was no reason why I should make myself\nridiculous by my attitude. I prepared to unbend. After all, she was\ndecidedly pretty.\u2026\n",
        "15": "\u201cThere! Now we\u2019re friends!\u201d declared the minx. \u201cSay you\u2019re sorry about\nmy sister\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI am desolated!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good boy!\u201d\n",

        "328": "\u201cIndeed, that might be one way of tracing them,\u201d continued the\nmagistrate, brightening. \u201cA motor containing two foreigners is quite\nlikely to have been noticed.
