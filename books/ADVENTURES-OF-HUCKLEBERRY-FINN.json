Aunt Polly\u2014Tom\u2019s Aunt Polly, she\nis\u2014and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book,\nwhich is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\nNow the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money\nthat the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six\n",
        "53": "thousand dollars apiece\u2014all gold. It was an awful sight of money when\nit was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at\ninterest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\nround\u2014more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas\n",
        "54": "she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\nrough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\nand decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn\u2019t stand\nit no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\nagain, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\nsaid he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\nwould go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.\n",
        "55": "The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\ncalled me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.\nShe put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn\u2019t do nothing but\nsweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing\ncommenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come\n",
        "56": "to time. When you got to the table you couldn\u2019t go right to eating, but\nyou had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a\nlittle over the victuals, though there warn\u2019t really anything the\nmatter with them,\u2014that is, nothing only everything was cooked by\nitself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed\nup, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\n",
        "57": "After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\nBulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but\nby-and-by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long\ntime; so then I didn\u2019t care no more about him, because I don\u2019t take no\nstock in dead people.\nPretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she\nwouldn\u2019t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn\u2019t clean, and I must\n",
        "58": "try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They\nget down on a thing when they don\u2019t know nothing about it. Here she was\na-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to\nanybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for\ndoing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of\n",
        "59": "course that was all right, because she done it herself.\nHer sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\nhad just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\nspelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\nthe widow made her ease up. I couldn\u2019t stood it much longer. Then for\n",
        "60": "an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.

She got mad then, but I didn\u2019t mean no harm. All I wanted\n",
        "61": "was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn\u2019t particular.\nShe said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn\u2019t say it for\nthe whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\nWell, I couldn\u2019t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I\nmade up my mind I wouldn\u2019t try for it. But I never said so, because it\n",
        "62": "would only make trouble, and wouldn\u2019t do no good.\nNow she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\nplace. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all\nday long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn\u2019t think much\n",
        "63": "of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\nwould go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad\nabout that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\n",
        "64": "Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\nBy-and-by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\neverybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\nand put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and\n",
        "65": "tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn\u2019t no use. I felt so\nlonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the\nleaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\noff, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\ndog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was\ntrying to whisper something to me, and I couldn\u2019t make out what it was,\nand so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods\n",
        "66": "I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell\nabout something that\u2019s on its mind and can\u2019t make itself understood,\nand so can\u2019t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every\nnight grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some\ncompany. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I\nflipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it\nwas all shriveled up. I didn\u2019t need anybody to tell me that that was an\n",

I got up and turned around in my\ntracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up\na little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I\nhadn\u2019t no confidence. You do that when you\u2019ve lost a horseshoe that\n",

Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go\nboom\u2014boom\u2014boom\u2014twelve licks; and all still again\u2014stiller than ever.\n",

        "71": "We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end\nof the widow\u2019s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn\u2019t scrape\nour heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and\nmade a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson\u2019s big\nnigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him\npretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and\n",
        "72": "stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:\n\u201cWho dah?\u201d\nHe listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right\nbetween us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes\n",
        "73": "and minutes that there warn\u2019t a sound, and we all there so close\ntogether.

        "77": "eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn\u2019t stand it more\u2019n a\nminute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then\nJim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore\u2014and then I was\npretty soon comfortable again.\n",

This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever\nwas in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different\nfrom what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my\nown time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my\nback to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was\nnothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them\ntattoo-marks.
