The fire\nburnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the\nlilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our\nglasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather\nthan submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious\nafter-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the\ntrammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way\u2014marking the\n",

But through a natural\n",

There are really four dimensions, three\nwhich we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is,\nhowever, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former\nthree dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our\nconsciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter\nfrom the beginning to the end of our lives.\u201d\n",

It\n",

See?\u201d\n\u201cI think so,\u201d murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows,\nhe lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who\nrepeats mystic words. \u201cYes, I think I see it now,\u201d he said after some\n",

And why cannot we move\nin Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?\u201d\n",
        "20": "The Time Traveller smiled. \u201cAre you so sure we can move freely in\nSpace? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,\nand men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions.\n",

Gravitation limits us there.\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d said the Medical Man. \u201cThere are balloons.\u201d\n\u201cBut before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the\ninequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.\u201d\n",

        "544": "pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.\u201d He stared round the room.\n\u201cI\u2019m damned if it isn\u2019t all going. This room and you and the atmosphere\nof every day is too much for my memory. Did I ever make a Time Machine,\n",
        "545": "or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all only a dream? They say life\nis a dream, a precious poor dream at times\u2014but I can\u2019t stand another\nthat won\u2019t fit. It\u2019s madness. And where did the dream come from? \u2026 I\nmust look at that machine. If there is one!\u201d\n",
        "546": "He caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the\ndoor into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering light\nof the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a\nthing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz. Solid\nto the touch\u2014for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it\u2014and with\nbrown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon\nthe lower parts, and one rail bent awry.\n",
        "547": "The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand\nalong the damaged rail. \u201cIt\u2019s all right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe story I\ntold you was true. I\u2019m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold.\u201d\nHe took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we returned to the\nsmoking-room.\n",
        "548": "He came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat.\nThe Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation,\ntold him he was suffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely. I\nremember him standing in the open doorway, bawling good-night.\n",
        "549": "I shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a \u201cgaudy lie.\u201d For\nmy own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was so\nfantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay\n",
        "550": "awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go next day\nand see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the laboratory,\nand being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory,\n",
        "551": "however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and put\nout my hand and touched the lever. At that the squat\nsubstantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind. Its\n",
        "552": "instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of\nthe childish days when I used to be forbidden to meddle. I came back\nthrough the corridor. The Time Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He\nwas coming from the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a\n",
        "553": "knapsack under the other. He laughed when he saw me, and gave me an\nelbow to shake. \u201cI\u2019m frightfully busy,\u201d said he, \u201cwith that thing in\nthere.\u201d\n",
        "554": "\u201cBut is it not some hoax?\u201d I said. \u201cDo you really travel through time?\u201d\n\u201cReally and truly I do.\u201d And he looked frankly into my eyes. He\nhesitated. His eye wandered about the room. \u201cI only want half an hour,\u201d\n",
        "555": "he said. \u201cI know why you came, and it\u2019s awfully good of you. There\u2019s\nsome magazines here. If you\u2019ll stop to lunch I\u2019ll prove you this time\ntravelling up to the hilt, specimens and all. If you\u2019ll forgive my\n",
        "556": "leaving you now?\u201d\nI consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,\nand he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the\nlaboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper.\n",
        "557": "What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly I was reminded\nby an advertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson, the\npublisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely\nsave that engagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the\n",
        "558": "Time Traveller.\nAs I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly\ntruncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled\nround me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken\nglass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed\n",
        "559": "to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black\nand brass for a moment\u2014a figure so transparent that the bench behind\nwith its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm\nvanished as I rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a\nsubsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A\npane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in.\n",
        "560": "I felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had\nhappened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange\nthing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,\nand the man-servant appeared.\n",
        "561": "We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. \u201cHas Mr. \u2014\u2014 gone out\nthat way?\u201d said I.\n\u201cNo, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him\n",
        "562": "here.\u201d\nAt that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed\non, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps\nstill stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring\nwith him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime.\n",
        "563": "The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows\nnow, he has never returned.\n Epilogue\nOne cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he\n",
        "564": "swept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy\nsavages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the\nCretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian\nbrutes of the Jurassic times.
