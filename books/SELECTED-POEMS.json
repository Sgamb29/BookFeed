It's so young,\n",
        "5": "It totters when she licks it with her tongue.\nI shan't be gone long.\u2014-You come too.\nTHE COW IN APPLE-TIME\nSomething inspires the only cow of late\nTo make no more of a wall than an open gate,\nAnd think no more of wall-builders than fools.\n",
        "6": "Her face is flecked with pomace and she drools\nA cider syrup. Having tasted fruit,\nShe scorns a pasture withering to the root.\nShe runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten\nThe windfalls spiked with stubble and worm-eaten.\n",
        "7": "She leaves them bitten when she has to fly.\nShe bellows on a knoll against the sky.\nHer udder shrivels and the milk goes dry.\n",
        "8": "THE RUNAWAY\nOnce when the snow of the year was beginning to\nfall,\nWe stopped by a mountain pasture to say \"Whose\ncolt?\"\nA little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall,\nThe other curled at his breast. He dipped his head\nAnd snorted at us. And then he had to bolt.\n",
        "9": "We heard the miniature thunder where he fled,\nAnd we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and\ngrey,\nLike a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes.\n\"I think the little fellow's afraid of the snow.\nHe isn't winter-broken. It isn't play\n",
        "10": "With the little fellow at all. He's running away.\nI doubt if even his mother could tell him, 'Sakes,\nIt's only weather.' He'd think she didn't know!\nWhere is his mother? He can't be out alone.\"\n",
        "11": "And now he comes again with a clatter of stone\nAnd mounts the wall again with whited eyes\nAnd all his tail that isn't hair up straight.\nHe shudders his coat as if to throw off flies.\n\"Whoever it is that leaves him out so late,\nWhen other creatures have gone to stall and bin,\nOught to be told to come and take him in.\"\n",
        "12": "II\nAN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT\nAll out of doors looked darkly in at him\nThrough the thin frost, almost in separate stars,\nThat gathers on the pane in empty rooms.\nWhat kept his eyes from giving back the gaze\nWas the lamp tilted near them in his hand.\nWhat kept him from remembering what it was\nThat brought him to that creaking room was age.\n",
        "13": "He stood with barrels round him\u2014-at a loss.\nAnd having scared the cellar under him\nIn clomping there, he scared it once again\nIn clomping off;\u2014-and scared the outer night,\nWhich has its sounds, familiar, like the roar\nOf trees and crack of branches, common things,\nBut nothing so like beating on a box.\nA light he was to no one but himself\nWhere now he sat, concerned with he knew what,\nA quiet light, and then not even that.\n",
        "14": "He consigned to the moon, such as she was,\nSo late-arising, to the broken moon\nAs better than the sun in any case\nFor such a charge, his snow upon the roof,\nHis icicles along the wall to keep;\nAnd slept. The log that shifted with a jolt\nOnce in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,\nAnd eased his heavy breathing, but still slept.\nOne aged man\u2014-one man\u2014-can't keep a house,\nA farm, a countryside, or if he can,\nIt's thus he does it of a winter night.\n",
        "15": "HOME BURIAL\nHe saw her from the bottom of the stairs\nBefore she saw him. She was starting down,\nLooking back over her shoulder at some fear.\nShe took a doubtful step and then undid it\nTo raise herself and look again. He spoke\n",
        "16": "Advancing toward her: \"What is it you see\nFrom up there always\u2014-for I want to know.\"\nShe turned and sank upon her skirts at that,\nAnd her face changed from terrified to dull.\nHe said to gain time: \"What is it you see?\"\n",
        "17": "Mounting until she cowered under him.\n\"I will find out now\u2014you must tell me, dear.\"\nShe, in her place, refused him any help\nWith the least stiffening of her neck and silence.\n",
        "18": "She let him look, sure that he wouldn't see,\nBlind creature; and a while he didn't see.\nBut at last he murmured, \"Oh,\" and again, \"Oh.\"\n\"What is it\u2014what?\" she said.\n",
        "19": "\"Just that I see.\"\n\"You don't,\" she challenged. \"Tell me what it is.\"\n\"The wonder is I didn't see at once.\n",
        "20": "I never noticed it from here before.\nI must be wonted to it\u2014-that's the reason.\nThe little graveyard where my people are!\n",
        "21": "So small the window frames the whole of it.\nNot so much larger than a bedroom, is it?\nThere are three stones of slate and one of marble,\nBroad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight\nOn the sidehill. We haven't to mind _those._\n",
        "22": "But I understand: it is not the stones,\nBut the child's mound----\"\nDon't, don't, don't, don't,\" she cried.\nShe withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm\nThat rested on the banister, and slid downstairs;\nAnd turned on him with such a daunting look,\nHe said twice over before he knew himself:\n\"Can't a man speak of his own child he's lost?\"\n\"Not you! Oh, where's my hat? Oh, I don't\n",
        "23": "need it!\nI must get out of here. I must get air.\nI don't know rightly whether any man can.\"\n",
        "24": "\"Amy! Don't go to someone else this time.\nListen to me. I won't come down the stairs.\"\nHe sat and fixed his chin between his fists.\n",
        "25": "\"There's something I should like to ask you, dear.\"\n\"You don't know how to ask it.\"\n\"Help me, then.\"\n",
        "26": "Her fingers moved the latch for all reply.\n\"My words are nearly always an offence.\nI don't know how to speak of anything\nSo as to please you. But I might be taught\n",
        "27": "I should suppose. I can't say I see how.\nA man must partly give up being a man\nWith women-folk. We could have some\narrangement\nBy which I'd bind myself to keep hands off\nAnything special you're a-mind to name.\n",
        "28": "Though I don't like such things 'twixt those that\nlove.\nTwo that don't love can't live together without\nthem.\nBut two that do can't live together with them.\"\n",
        "29": "She moved the latch a little. \"Don't\u2014-don't go.\nDon't carry it to someone else this time.\nTell me about it if it's something human.\n",
        "30": "Let me into your grief. I'm not so much\nUnlike other folks as your standing there\nApart would make me out. Give me my chance.\nI do think, though, you overdo it a little.\n",
        "31": "What was it brought you up to think it the thing\nTo take your mother-loss of a first child\nSo inconsolably\u2014in the face of love.\nYou'd think his memory might be satisfied----\"\n\"There you go sneering now!\"\n\"I'm not, I'm not!\n",
        "32": "You make me angry. I'll come down to you.\nGod, what a woman! And it's come to this,\nA man can't speak of his own child that's dead.\"\n",
        "33": "\"You can't because you don't know how.\nIf you had any feelings, you that dug\nWith your own hand\u2014-how could you?\u2014-his little\ngrave;\nI saw you from that very window there,\nMaking the gravel leap and leap in air,\nLeap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly\nAnd roll back down the mound beside the hole.\n",
        "34": "I thought, Who is that man? I didn't know you.\nAnd I crept down the stairs and up the stairs\nTo look again, and still your spade kept lifting.\nThen you came in. I heard your rumbling voice\n",
        "35": "Out in the kitchen, and I don't know why,\nBut I went near to see with my own eyes.\nYou could sit there with the stains on your shoes\nOf the fresh earth from your own baby's grave\nAnd talk about your everyday concerns.\nYou had stood the spade up against the wall\nOutside there in the entry, for I saw it.\"\n",
        "36": "\"I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed.\nI'm cursed. God, if I don't believe I'm cursed.\"\n\"I can repeat the very words you were saying.\n",
        "37": "'Three foggy mornings and one rainy day\nWill rot the best birch fence a man can build.'\nThink of it, talk like that at such a time!\nWhat had how long it takes a birch to rot\nTo do with what was in the darkened parlour?\n",
        "38": "You _couldn't_ care! The nearest friends can go\nWith anyone to death, comes so far short\nThey might as well not try to go at all.\nNo, from the time when one is sick to death,\nOne is alone, and he dies more alone.\n",
        "39": "Friends make pretence of following to the grave,\nBut before one is in it, their minds are turned\nAnd making the best of their way back to life\nAnd living people, and things they understand.\nBut the world's evil. I won't have grief so\nIf I can change it. Oh, I won't, I won't!\"\n",
        "40": "\"There, you have said it all and you feel better.\nYou won't go now. You're crying. Close the door.\nThe heart's gone out of it: why keep it up?\n",
        "41": "Amy! There's someone coming down the road!\"\n\"_You_-\u2014oh, you think the talk is all. I must go\u2014-\nSomewhere out of this house. How can I make\n",
        "42": "you----\"\n\"If\u2014-you\u2014-do!\" She was opening the door wider.\n\"Where do you mean to go? First tell me that.\nI'll follow and bring you back by force. I _will!_\u2014-\"\n",
        "43": "THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN\nMary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table\nWaiting for Warren. When she heard his step,\nShe ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage\nTo meet him in the doorway with the news\nAnd put him on his guard. \"Silas is back.\"\nShe pushed him outward with her through the door\nAnd shut it after her. \"Be kind,\" she said.\n",
        "44": "She took the market things from Warren's arms\nAnd set them on the porch, then drew him down\nTo sit beside her on the wooden steps.\n\"When was I ever anything but kind to him?\nBut I'll not have the fellow back,\" he said.\n",
        "45": "\"I told him so last haying, didn't I?\n'If he left then,' I said, 'that ended it.'\nWhat good is he? Who else will harbour him\n",
        "46": "At his age for the little he can do?\nWhat help he is there's no depending on.\nOff he goes always when I need him most.\n",
        "47": "'He thinks he ought to earn a little pay,\nEnough at least to buy tobacco with,\nSo he won't have to beg and be beholden.'\n'All right,' I say, 'I can't afford to pay\nAny fixed wages, though I wish I could.'\n'Someone else can.' 'Then someone else will have\n",
        "48": "to.'\nI shouldn't mind his bettering himself\nIf that was what it was. You can be certain,\nWhen he begins like that, there's someone at him\nTrying to coax him off with pocket-money,\u2014-\nIn haying time, when any help is scarce.\n",
        "49": "In winter he comes back to us. I'm done.\"\n\"Sh! not so loud: he'll hear you,\" Mary said.\n\"I want him to: he'll have to soon or late.\"\n",
        "50": "\"He's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove.\nWhen I came up from Rowe's I found him here,\nHuddled against the barn-door fast asleep,\nA miserable sight, and frightening, too\u2014-\nYou needn't smile\u2014-I didn't recognise him\u2014-\nI wasn't looking for him\u2014-and he's changed.\nWait till you see.\"\n",
        "51": "\"Where did you say he'd been?\"\n\"He didn't say. I dragged him to the house,\nAnd gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.\n",
        "52": "I tried to make him talk about his travels.\nNothing would do: he just kept nodding off.\"\n\"What did he say? Did he say anything?\"\n",
        "53": "\"But little.\"\n\"Anything? Mary, confess\nHe said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me.\"\n",
        "54": "\"Warren!\"\n\"But did he? I just want to know.\"\n\"Of course he did. What would you have him say?\n",
        "55": "Surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man\nSome humble way to save his self-respect.\nHe added, if you really care to know,\nHe meant to clear the upper pasture, too.\nThat sounds like something you have heard before?\n",
        "56": "Warren, I wish you could have heard the way\nHe jumbled everything. I stopped to look\nTwo or three times\u2014-he made me feel so queer\u2014-\nTo see if he was talking in his sleep.\nHe ran on Harold Wilson\u2014-you remember\u2014-\nThe boy you had in haying four years since.\n",
        "57": "He's finished school, and teaching in his college.\nSilas declares you'll have to get him back.\nHe says they two will make a team for work:\nBetween them they will lay this farm as smooth!\n",
        "58": "The way he mixed that in with other things.\nHe thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft\nOn education\u2014-you know how they fought\nAll through July under the blazing sun,\nSilas up on the cart to build the load,\nHarold along beside to pitch it on.\"\n\"Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot.\"\n",
        "59": "\"Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream.\nYou wouldn't think they would. How some things\nlinger!\n",
        "60": "Harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him.\nAfter so many years he still keeps finding\nGood arguments he sees he might have used.\nI sympathise. I know just how it feels\n",
        "61": "To think of the right thing to say too late.\nHarold's associated in his mind with Latin.\nHe asked me what I thought of Harold's saying\nHe studied Latin like the violin\nBecause he liked it\u2014-that an argument!\n",
        "62": "He said he couldn't make the boy believe\nHe could find water with a hazel prong\u2014-\nWhich showed how much good school had ever done\nhim.\nHe wanted to go over that. But most of all\nHe thinks if he could have another chance\nTo teach him how to build a load of hay----\"\n\"I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment.\n",
        "63": "He bundles every forkful in its place,\nAnd tags and numbers it for future reference,\nSo he can find and easily dislodge it\nIn the unloading. Silas does that well.\nHe takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests.\nYou never see him standing on the hay\nHe's trying to lift, straining to lift himself.\"\n",
        "64": "\"He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be\nSome good perhaps to someone in the world.\nHe hates to see a boy the fool of books.\nPoor Silas, so concerned for other folk,\nAnd nothing to look backward to with pride,\nAnd nothing to look forward to with hope,\nSo now and never any different.\"\n",
        "65": "Part of a moon was falling down the west,\nDragging the whole sky with it to the hills.\nIts light poured softly in her lap. She saw\nAnd spread her apron to it. She put out her hand\n",
        "66": "Among the harp-like morning-glory strings,\nTaut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,\nAs if she played unheard the tenderness\nThat wrought on him beside her in the night.\n\"Warren,\" she said, \"he has come home to die:\nYou needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time.\"\n\"Home,\" he mocked gently.\n",
        "67": "\"Yes, what else but home?\nIt all depends on what you mean by home.\nOf course he's nothing to us, any more\nThan was the hound that came a stranger to us\nOut of the woods, worn out upon the trail.\"\n",
        "68": "\"Home is the place where, when you have to go\nthere,\nThey have to take you in.\"\n\"I should have called it\nSomething you somehow haven't to deserve.\"\nWarren leaned out and took a step or two,\nPicked up a little stick, and brought it back\nAnd broke it in his hand and tossed it by.\n",
        "69": "\"Silas has better claim on us, you think,\nThan on his brother? Thirteen little miles\nAs the road winds would bring him to his door.\nSilas has walked that far no doubt to-day.\n",
        "70": "Why didn't he go there? His brother's rich,\nA somebody\u2014-director in the bank.\"\n\"He never told us that.\"\n",
        "71": "\"We know it though.\"\n\"I think his brother ought to help, of course.\nI'll see to that if there is need. He ought of right\n",
        "72": "To take him in, and might be willing to\u2014-\nHe may be better than appearances.\nBut have some pity on Silas. Do you think\nIf he'd had any pride in claiming kin\nOr anything he looked for from his brother,\nHe'd keep so still about him all this time?\"\n",
        "73": "\"I wonder what's between them.\"\n\"I can tell you.\nSilas is what he is\u2014-we wouldn't mind him\u2014-\nBut just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide.\n",
        "74": "He never did a thing so very bad.\nHe don't know why he isn't quite as good\nAs anyone. He won't be made ashamed\nTo please his brother, worthless though he is.\"\n",
        "75": "\"_I_ can't think Si ever hurt anyone.\"\n\"No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay\nAnd rolled his old head on that sharp-edged\nchair-back.\nHe wouldn't let me put him on the lounge.\n",
        "76": "You must go in and see what you can do.\nI made the bed up for him there to-night.\nYou'll be surprised at him\u2014-how much he's broken.\n",
        "77": "His working days are done; I'm sure of it.\"\n\"I'd not be in a hurry to say that.\"\n\"I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself.\n",
        "78": "But, Warren, please remember how it is:\nHe's come to help you ditch the meadow.\nHe has a plan. You mustn't laugh at him.\nHe may not speak of it, and then he may.\n",
        "79": "I'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud\nWill hit or miss the moon.\"\nIt hit the moon.\nThen there were three there, making a dim row,\nThe moon, the little silver cloud, and she.\n",
        "80": "Warren returned\u2014-too soon, it seemed to her,\nSlipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited.\n\"Warren,\" she questioned.\n\"Dead,\" was all he answered.\n",
        "81": "A SERVANT TO SERVANTS\nI didn't make you know how glad I was\nTo have you come and camp here on our land.\nI promised myself to get down some day\nAnd see the way you lived, but I don't know!\nWith a houseful of hungry men to feed\nI guess you'd find. ... It seems to me\n",
        "82": "I can't express my feelings any more\nThan I can raise my voice or want to lift\nMy hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to).\nDid ever you feel so? I hope you never.\nIt's got so I don't even know for sure\nWhether I _am_ glad, sorry, or anything.\n",
        "83": "There's nothing but a voice-like left inside\nThat seems to tell me how I ought to feel,\nAnd would feel if I wasn't all gone wrong.\nYou take the lake. I look and look at it.\nI see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water.\n",
        "84": "I stand and make myself repeat out loud\nThe advantages it has, so long and narrow,\nLike a deep piece of some old running river\nCut short off at both ends. It lies five miles\nStraight away through the mountain notch\nFrom the sink window where I wash the plates,\nAnd all our storms come up toward the house,\nDrawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and\nwhiter.\nIt took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit\nTo step outdoors and take the water dazzle\nA sunny morning, or take the rising wind\nAbout my face and body and through my wrapper,\nWhen a storm threatened from the Dragon's Den,\nAnd a cold chill shivered across the lake.\n",
        "85": "I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,\nOur Willoughby! How did you hear of it?\nI expect, though, everyone's heard of it.\nIn a book about ferns? Listen to that!\n",
        "86": "You let things more like feathers regulate\nYour going and coming. And you like it here?\nI can see how you might. But I don't know!\nIt would be different if more people came,\nFor then there would be business. As it is,\n",
        "87": "The cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them,\nSometimes we don't. We've a good piece of shore\nThat ought to be worth something, and may yet.\nBut I don't count on it as much as Len.\n",
        "88": "He looks on the bright side of everything,\nIncluding me. He thinks I'll be all right\nWith doctoring. But it's not medicine\u2014-\nLowe is the only doctor's dared to say so\u2014-\nIt's rest I want\u2014-there, I have said it out\u2014-\nFrom cooking meals for hungry hired men\nAnd washing dishes after them\u2014-from doing\nThings over and over that just won't stay done.\n",
        "89": "By good rights I ought not to have so much\nPut on me, but there seems no other way.\nLen says one steady pull more ought to do it.\nHe says the best way out is always through.\n",
        "90": "And I agree to that, or in so far\nAs that I can see no way out but through\u2014-\nLeastways for me\u2014-and then they'll be convinced.\nIt's not that Len don't want the best for me.\nIt was his plan our moving over in\nBeside the lake from where that day I showed you\nWe used to live\u2014-ten miles from anywhere\nWe didn't change without some sacrifice,\nBut Len went at it to make up the loss.\n",
        "91": "His work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun,\nBut he works when he works as hard as I do\u2014-\nThough there's small profit in comparisons.\n(Women and men will make them all the same.)\nBut work ain't all. Len undertakes too much.\n",
        "92": "He's into everything in town. This year\nIt's highways, and he's got too many men\nAround him to look after that make waste.\nThey take advantage of him shamefully,\nAnd proud, too, of themselves for doing so.\n",
        "93": "We have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,\nSprawling about the kitchen with their talk\nWhile I fry their bacon. Much they care!\nNo more put out in what they do or say\nThan if I wasn't in the room at all.\nComing and going all the time, they are:\nI don't learn what their names are, let alone\nTheir characters, or whether they are safe\nTo have inside the house with doors unlocked.\n",
        "94": "I'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not\nAfraid of me. There's two can play at that.\nI have my fancies: it runs in the family.\nMy father's brother wasn't right. They kept him\n",
        "95": "Locked up for years back there at the old farm.\nI've been away once\u2014-yes, I've been away.\nThe State Asylum. I was prejudiced;\n",
        "96": "I wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there;\nYou know the old idea\u2014-the only asylum\nWas the poorhouse, and those who could afford,\nRather than send their folks to such a place,\nKept them at home; and it does seem more human.\nBut it's not so: the place is the asylum.\nThere they have every means proper to do with,\nAnd you aren't darkening other people's lives\u2014-\nWorse than no good to them, and they no good\nTo you in your condition; you can't know\nAffection or the want of it in that state.\n",
        "97": "I've heard too much of the old-fashioned way.\nMy father's brother, he went mad quite young.\nSome thought he had been bitten by a dog,\nBecause his violence took on the form\nOf carrying his pillow in his teeth;\nBut it's more likely he was crossed in love,\nOr so the story goes. It was some girl.\n",
        "98": "Anyway, all he talked about was love.\nThey soon saw he would do someone a mischief\nIf he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended\nIn father's building him a sort of cage,\nOr room within a room, of hickory poles,\nLike stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,\u2014-\nA narrow passage all the way around.\nAnything they put in for furniture\nHe'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on.\n",
        "99": "So they made the place comfortable with straw,\nLike a beast's stall, to ease their consciences.\nOf course they had to feed him without dishes.\nThey tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded\nWith his clothes on his arm\u2014-all of his clothes.\n",
        "100": "Cruel\u2014-it sounds. I s'pose they did the best\nThey knew. And just when he was at the height,\nFather and mother married, and mother came,\nA bride, to help take care of such a creature,\nAnd accommodate her young life to his.\n",
        "101": "That was what marrying father meant to her.\nShe had to lie and hear love things made dreadful\nBy his shouts in the night. He'd shout and shout\nUntil the strength was shouted out of him,\nAnd his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.\n",
        "102": "He'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,\nAnd let them go and make them twang until\nHis hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.\nAnd then he'd crow as if he thought that child's\nplay\u2014-\nThe only fun he had. I've heard them say, though,\nThey found a way to put a stop to it.\n",
        "103": "He was before my time\u2014-I never saw him;\nBut the pen stayed exactly as it was\nThere in the upper chamber in the ell,\nA sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.\nI often think of the smooth hickory bars.\nIt got so I would say--you know, half fooling\u2014-\n\"It's time I took my turn upstairs in jail\"\u2014-\nJust as you will till it becomes a habit.\n",

I should soon get enough,\n",
        "107": "And be glad of a good roof overhead.\nI've lain awake thinking of you, I'll warrant,\nMore than you have yourself, some of these nights.\nThe wonder was the tents weren't snatched away\nFrom over you as you lay in your beds.\n",
        "108": "I haven't courage for a risk like that.\nBless you, of course, you're keeping me from work,\nBut the thing of it is, I need to _be_ kept.\nThere's work enough to do\u2014-there's always that;\nBut behind's behind. The worst that you can do\n",

        "142": "But, Anne, I'm troubled; have you told me all?\nYou're hiding something. That's as bad as lying.\nYou ask this lawyer man. And it's not safe\n",

You're the Heart's desire.'\nAnne has a way with flowers to take the place\nOf that she's lost: she goes down on one knee\nAnd lifts their faces by the chin to hers\nAnd says their names, and leaves them where they\nare.\"\nThe lawyer wore a watch the case of which\nWas cunningly devised to make a noise\nLike a small pistol when he snapped it shut\nAt such a time as this.

        "149": "\"Well, Anne, go, dearie. Our affair will wait.\nThe lawyer man is thinking of his train.\nHe wants to give me lots and lots of money\nBefore he goes, because I hurt myself,\nAnd it may take him I don't know how long.\n",

        "154": "I'll put you out with Anne. Be good or go.\"\n\"You don't mean you will sign that thing unread?\"\n\"Make yourself useful then, and read it for me.\n",
        "155": "Isn't it something I have seen before?\"\n\"You'll find it is. Let your friend look at it.\"\n\"Yes, but all that takes time, and I'm as much\nIn haste to get it over with as you.\n",
        "156": "But read it, read it. That's right, draw the curtain:\nHalf the time I don't know what's troubling me.\u2014-\nWhat do you say, Will? Don't you be a fool.\n",
        "157": "You! crumpling folkses' legal documents.\nOut with it if you've any real objection.\"\n\"Five hundred dollars!\"\n",
        "158": "\"What would you think right?\"\n\"A thousand wouldn't be a cent too much;\nYou know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is\nAccepting anything before he knows\nWhether he's ever going to walk again.\n",
        "159": "It smells to me like a dishonest trick.\"\n\"I think\u2014-I think\u2014-from what I heard to-day\u2014-\nAnd saw myself\u2014-he would be ill-advised----\"\n\"What did you hear, for instance?\" Willis said.\n\"Now the place where the accident occurred----\"\nThe Broken One was twisted in his bed.\n",

        "162": "One of you hold my head up from the pillow.\"\nWillis flung off the bed. \"I wash my hands\u2014-\nI'm no match\u2014-no, and don't pretend to be----\"\nThe lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen.\n",

        "189": "Were he not gone,\nThe woodchuck could say whether it's like his\nLong sleep, as I describe its coming on,\nOr just some human sleep.\nBIRCHES\nWhen I see birches bend to left and right\nAcross the lines of straighter darker trees,\nI like to think some boy's been swinging them.\nBut swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.\n",
        "190": "Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them\nLoaded with ice a sunny winter morning\nAfter a rain. They click upon themselves\nAs the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured\nAs the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.\n",
        "191": "Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal\nshells\nShattering and avalanching on the snow-crust\u2014-\nSuch heaps of broken glass to sweep away\nYou'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.\nThey are dragged to the withered bracken by the\nload,\nAnd they seem not to break; though once they are\nbowed\nSo low for long, they never right themselves:\nYou may see their trunks arching in the woods\nYears afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground,\nLike girls on hands and knees that throw their hair\nBefore them over their heads to dry in the sun.\nBut I was going to say when Truth broke in\nWith all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm,\nI should prefer to have some boy bend them\nAs he went out and in to fetch the cows\u2014-\nSome boy too far from town to learn baseball,\nWhose only play was what he found himself,\nSummer or winter, and could play alone.\n",
        "192": "One by one he subdued his father's trees\nBy riding them down over and over again\nUntil he took the stiffness out of them,\nAnd not one but hung limp, not one was left\nFor him to conquer. He learned all there was\nTo learn about not launching out too soon\nAnd so not carrying the tree away\nClear to the ground. He always kept his poise\nTo the top branches, climbing carefully\nWith the same pains you use to fill a cup\nUp to the brim, and even above the brim.\n",
        "193": "Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,\nKicking his way down through the air to the ground.\nSo was I once myself a swinger of birches.\nAnd so I dream of going back to be.\n",
        "194": "It's when I'm weary of considerations,\nAnd life is too much like a pathless wood\nWhere your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs\nBroken across it, and one eye is weeping\nFrom a twig's having lashed across it open.\nI'd like to get away from earth awhile\nAnd then come back to it and begin over.\nMay no fate wilfully misunderstand me\nAnd half grant what I wish and snatch me away\nNot to return. Earth's the right place for love:\n",
        "195": "I don't know where it's likely to go better.\nI'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,\nAnd climb black branches up a snow-white trunk\n_Toward_ heaven, till the tree could bear no more,\nBut dipped its top and set me down again.\nThat would be good both going and coming back.\n",
        "196": "One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.\nTHE GUM-GATHERER\nThere overtook me and drew me in\nTo his down-hill, early-morning stride,\nAnd set me five miles on my road\nBetter than if he had had me ride,\nA man with a swinging bag for load\nAnd half the bag wound round his hand.\nWe talked like barking above the din\nOf water we walked along beside.\n",
        "197": "And for my telling him where I'd been\nAnd where I lived in mountain land\nTo be coming home the way I was,\nHe told me a little about himself.\nHe came from higher up in the pass\nWhere the grist of the new-beginning brooks\nIs blocks split off the mountain mass\u2014-\nAnd hopeless grist enough it looks\nEver to grind to soil for grass.\n(The way it is will do for moss.)\n",
        "198": "There he had built his stolen shack.\nIt had to be a stolen shack\nBecause of the fears of fire and loss\nThat trouble the sleep of lumber folk:\nVisions of half the world burned black\nAnd the sun shrunken yellow in smoke.\nWe know who when they come to town\nBring berries under the wagon seat,\nOr a basket of eggs between their feet;\nWhat this man brought in a cotton sack\nWas gum, the gum of the mountain spruce.\n",
        "199": "He showed me lumps of the scented stuff\nLike uncut jewels, dull and rough.\nIt comes to market golden brown;\nBut turns to pink between the teeth.\nI told him this is a pleasant life\nTo set your breast to the bark of trees\nThat all your days are dim beneath,\nAnd reaching up with a little knife,\nTo loose the resin and take it down\nAnd bring it to market when you please.\n",
        "200": "THE MOUNTAIN\nThe mountain held the town as in a shadow.\nI saw so much before I slept there once:\nI noticed that I missed stars in the west,\nWhere its black body cut into the sky.\nNear me it seemed: I felt it like a wall\nBehind which I was sheltered from a wind.\n",
        "201": "And yet between the town and it I found,\nWhen I walked forth at dawn to see new things,\nWere fields, a river, and beyond, more fields.\nThe river at the time was fallen away,\nAnd made a widespread brawl on cobble-stones;\nBut the signs showed what it had done in spring;\nGood grass-land gullied out, and in the grass\nRidges of sand, and driftwood stripped of bark.\nI crossed the river and swung round the mountain.\n",
        "202": "And there I met a man who moved so slow\nWith white-faced oxen in a heavy cart,\nIt seemed no harm to stop him altogether.\n\"What town is this?\" I asked.\n\"This? Lunenburg.\"\n",
        "203": "Then I was wrong: the town of my sojourn,\nBeyond the bridge, was not that of the mountain,\nBut only felt at night its shadowy presence.\n\"Where is your village? Very far from here?\"\n\"There is no village\u2014-only scattered farms.\n",
        "204": "We were but sixty voters last election.\nWe can't in nature grow to many more:\nThat thing takes all the room!\" He moved his goad.\nThe mountain stood there to be pointed at.\n",
        "205": "Pasture ran up the side a little way,\nAnd then there was a wall of trees with trunks:\nAfter that only tops of trees, and cliffs\nImperfectly concealed among the leaves.\nA dry ravine emerged from under boughs\nInto the pasture.\n\"That looks like a path.\n",
        "206": "Is that the way to reach the top from here?\u2014-\nNot for this morning, but some other time:\nI must be getting back to breakfast now.\"\n\"I don't advise your trying from this side.\n",
        "207": "There is no proper path, but those that _have_\nBeen up, I understand, have climbed from Ladd's.\nThat's five miles back. You can't mistake the place:\nThey logged it there last winter some way up.\n",
        "208": "I'd take you, but I'm bound the other way.\"\n\"You've never climbed it?\"\n\"I've been on the sides\nDeer-hunting and trout-fishing. There's a brook\n",
        "209": "That starts up on it somewhere\u2014-I've heard say\nRight on the top, tip-top\u2014-a curious thing.\nBut what would interest you about the brook,\nIt's always cold in summer, warm in winter.\nOne of the great sights going is to see\nIt steam in winter like an ox's breath.\n",
        "210": "Until the bushes all along its banks\nAre inch-deep with the frosty spines and bristles\u2014-\nYou know the kind. Then let the sun shine on it!\"\n\"There ought to be a view around the world\nFrom such a mountain\u2014-if it isn't wooded\nClear to the top.\" I saw through leafy screens\nGreat granite terraces in sun and shadow,\nShelves one could rest a knee on getting up\u2014-\nWith depths behind him sheer a hundred feet;\nOr turn and sit on and look out and down,\nWith little ferns in crevices at his elbow.\n",
        "211": "\"As to that I can't say. But there's the spring,\nRight on the summit, almost like a fountain.\nThat ought to be worth seeing.\"\n",
        "212": "\"If it's there.\nYou never saw it?\"\nI guess there's no doubt\nAbout its being there. I never saw it.\n",
        "213": "It may not be right on the very top:\nIt wouldn't have to be a long way down\nTo have some head of water from above,\nAnd a _good distance_ down might not be noticed\nBy anyone who'd come a long way up.\nOne time I asked a fellow climbing it\nTo look and tell me later how it was.\"\n\"What did he say?\"\n",
        "214": "\"He said there was a lake\nSomewhere in Ireland on a mountain top.\"\n\"But a lake's different. What about the spring?\"\n\"He never got up high enough to see.\n",
        "215": "That's why I don't advise your trying this side.\nHe tried this side. I've always meant to go\nAnd look myself, but you know how it is:\nIt doesn't seem so much to climb a mountain\nYou've worked around the foot of all your life.\n",
        "216": "What would I do? Go in my overalls,\nWith a big stick, the same as when the cows\nHaven't come down to the bars at milking time?\nOr with a shotgun for a stray black bear?\n",
        "217": "'Twouldn't seem real to climb for climbing it.\"\n\"I shouldn't climb it if I didn't want to\u2014-\nNot for the sake of climbing. What's its name?\"\n\"We call it Hor: I don't know if that's right.\"\n",
        "218": "\"Can one walk round it? Would it be too far?\"\n\"You can drive round and keep in Lunenburg,\nBut it's as much as ever you can do,\nThe boundary lines keep in so close to it.\nHor is the township, and the township's Hor\u2014-\n_And_ a few houses sprinkled round the foot,\nLike boulders broken off the upper cliff,\nRolled out a little farther than the rest.\"\n",
        "219": "\"Warm in December, cold in June, you say?\"\n\"I don't suppose the waters changed at all.\nYou and I know enough to know it's warm\nCompared with cold, and cold compared with warm.\n",
        "220": "But all the fun's in how you say a thing.\"\n\"You've lived here all your life?\"\n\"Ever since Hor\nWas no bigger than a----\" What, I did not hear.\n",
        "221": "He drew the oxen toward him with light touches\nOf his slim goad on nose and offside flank,\nGave them their marching orders, and was moving.\nTHE TUFT OF FLOWERS\nI went to turn the grass once after one\nWho mowed it in the dew before the sun.\nThe dew was gone that made his blade so keen\nBefore I came to view the levelled scene.\n",
        "222": "I looked for him behind an isle of trees;\nI listened for his whetstone on the breeze.\nBut he had gone his way, the grass all mown,\nAnd I must be, as he had been\u2014-alone,\n\"As all must be,\" I said within my heart,\n\"Whether they work together or apart.\"\nBut as I said it, swift there passed me by\nOn noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly,\nSeeking with memories grown dim o'er night\nSome resting flower of yesterday's delight.\n",
        "223": "And once I marked his flight go round and round,\nAs where some flower lay withering on the ground.\nAnd then he flew as far as eye could see,\nAnd then on tremulous wing came back to me.\nI thought of questions that have no reply,\nAnd would have turned to toss the grass to dry;\nBut he turned first, and led my eye to look\nAt a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,\nA leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared\nBeside a reedy brook the scythe had bared.\n",
        "224": "I left my place to know them by their name,\nFinding them butterfly weed when I came.\nThe mower in the dew had loved them thus,\nBy leaving them to flourish, not for us,\nNor yet to draw one thought of ours to him.\nBut from sheer morning gladness at the brim.\n",
        "225": "The butterfly and I had lit upon,\nNevertheless, a message from the dawn.\nThat made me hear the wakening birds around,\nAnd hear his long scythe whispering to the ground,\nAnd feel a spirit kindred to my own;\nSo that henceforth I worked no more alone;\nBut glad with him, I worked as with his aid,\nAnd weary, sought at noon with him the shade;\nAnd dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech\nWith one whose thought I had not hoped to reach.\n\"Men work together,\" I told him from the heart,\n\"Whether they work together or apart.\"\n",
        "226": "MENDING WALL\nSomething there is that doesn't love a wall,\nThat sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,\nAnd spills the upper boulders in the sun;\nAnd makes gaps even two can pass abreast.\nThe work of hunters is another thing:\nI have come after them and made repair\nWhere they have left not one stone on a stone,\nBut they would have the rabbit out of hiding,\nTo please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,\nNo one has seen them made or heard them made,\nBut at spring mending-time we find them there.\n",
        "227": "I let my neighbour know beyond the hill;\nAnd on a day we meet to walk the line\nAnd set the wall between us once again.\nWe keep the wall between us as we go.\nTo each the boulders that have fallen to each.\n",
        "228": "And some are loaves and some so nearly balls\nWe have to use a spell to make them balance:\n\"Stay where you are until our backs are turned!\"\nWe wear our fingers rough with handling them.\nOh, just another kind of out-door game,\nOne on a side. It comes to little more:\n",
        "229": "There where it is we do not need the wall:\nHe is all pine and I am apple orchard.\nMy apple trees will never get across\nAnd eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.\nHe only says, \"Good fences make good neighbours.\"\n",
        "230": "Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder\nIf I could put a notion in his head:\n\"_Why_ do they make good neighbours? Isn't it\nWhere there are cows? But here there are no cows.\nBefore I built a wall I'd ask to know\nWhat I was walling in or walling out,\nAnd to whom I was like to give offence.\n",
        "231": "Something there is that doesn't love a wall,\nThat wants it down.\" I could say \"Elves\" to him,\nBut it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather\nHe said it for himself. I see him there\nBringing a stone grasped firmly by the top\nIn each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.\n",
        "232": "He moves in darkness as it seems to me,\nNot of woods only and the shade of trees.\nHe will not go behind his father's saying,\nAnd he likes having thought of it so well\nHe says again, \"Good fences make good\nneighbours.\"\nAN ENCOUNTER\nOnce on the kind of day called \"weather breeder,\"\nWhen the heat slowly hazes and the sun\nBy its own power seems to be undone,\nI was half boring through, half climbing through,\nA swamp of cedar. Choked with oil of cedar\n",
        "233": "And scurf of plants, and weary and over-heated,\nAnd sorry I ever left the road I knew,\nI paused and rested on a sort of hook\nThat had me by the coat as good as seated,\nAnd since there was no other way to look,\nLooked up toward heaven, and there against the\nblue\nStood over me a resurrected tree,\nA tree that had been down and raised again\u2014-\nA barkless spectre. He had halted too,\nAs if for fear of treading upon me.\nI saw the strange position of his hands\u2014-\nUp at his shoulders, dragging yellow strands\nOf wire with something in it from men to men.\n",
        "234": "\"You here?\" I said. \"Where aren't you nowadays?\nAnd what's the news you carry\u2014-if you know?\nAnd tell me where you're off for-\u2014Montreal?\n",
        "235": "Me? I'm not off for anywhere at all.\nSometimes I wander out of beaten ways\nHalf looking for the orchid Calypso.\"\nTHE WOOD-PILE\nOut walking in the frozen swamp one gray day\nI paused and said, \"I will turn back from here.\n",
        "236": "No, I will go on farther\u2014-and we shall see.\"\nThe hard snow held me, save where now and then\nOne foot went through. The view was all in lines\nStraight up and down of tall slim trees\nToo much alike to mark or name a place by\nSo as to say for certain I was here\nOr somewhere else: I was just far from home.\n",
        "237": "A small bird flew before me. He was careful\nTo put a tree between us when he lighted,\nAnd say no word to tell me who he was\nWho was so foolish as to think what _he_ thought.\nHe thought that I was after him for a feather\u2014-\nThe white one in his tail; like one who takes\nEverything said as personal to himself.\n",
        "238": "One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.\nAnd then there was a pile of wood for which\nI forgot him and let his little fear\nCarry him off the way I might have gone,\nWithout so much as wishing him good-night.\nHe went behind it to make his last stand.\n",
        "239": "It was a cord of maple, cut and split\nAnd piled\u2014-and measured, four by four by eight.\nAnd not another like it could I see.\nNo runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.\n",
        "240": "And it was older sure than this year's cutting,\nOr even last year's or the year's before.\nThe wood was gray and the bark warping off it\nAnd the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis\nHad wound strings round and round it like a bundle.\n",
        "241": "What held it though on one side was a tree\nStill growing, and on one a stake and prop,\nThese latter about to fall. I thought that only\nSomeone who lived in turning to fresh tasks\nCould so forget his handiwork on which\nHe spent himself, the labour of his axe,\nAnd leave it there far from a useful fireplace\nTo warm the frozen swamp as best it could\nWith the slow smokeless burning of decay.\nV\nSNOW\nThe three stood listening to a fresh access\nOf wind that caught against the house a moment,\nGulped snow, and then blew free again\u2014-the Coles\nDressed, but dishevelled from some hours of sleep,\nMeserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore.\n",
        "242": "Meserve was first to speak. He pointed backward\nOver his shoulder with his pipe-stem, saying,\n\"You can just see it glancing off the roof\nMaking a great scroll upward toward the sky,\nLong enough for recording all our names on;\nI think I'll just call up my wife and tell her\nI'm here\u2014-so far\u2014-and starting on again.\nI'll call her softly so that if she's wise\nAnd gone to sleep, she needn't wake to answer.\"\n",
        "243": "Three times he barely stirred the bell, then listened.\n\"Why, Lett, still up? Lett, I'm at Cole's. I'm late.\nI called you up to say Good-night from here\nBefore I went to say Good-morning there.\u2014-\n",
        "244": "I thought I would.\u2014-I know, but, Lett\u2014-I know\u2014-\nI could, but what's the sense? The rest won't be\nSo bad.\u2014-Give me an hour for it.\u2014-Ho, ho!\n",
        "245": "Three hours to here! But that was all up hill;\nThe rest is down.\u2014-Why, no, no, not a wallow:\nThey kept their heads and took their time to it\nLike darlings, both of them. They're in the barn.\u2014-\n",
        "246": "My dear, I'm coming just the same. I didn't\nCall you to ask you to invite me home.\u2014-\"\nHe lingered for some word she wouldn't say,\nSaid it at last himself, \"Good-night,\" and then,\nGetting no answer, closed the telephone.\n",
        "247": "The three stood in the lamplight round the table\nWith lowered eyes a moment till he said,\n\"I'll just see how the horses are.\"\n\"Yes, do,\"\nBoth the Coles said together. Mrs. Cole\nAdded: \"You can judge better after seeing.\u2014-\n",
        "248": "I want you here with me, Fred. Leave him here,\nBrother Meserve. You know to find your way\nOut through the shed.\"\n",
        "249": "\"I guess I know my way,\nI guess I know where I can find my name\nCarved in the shed to tell me who I am\nIf it don't tell me where I am. I used\nTo play----\"\n\"You tend your horses and come back.\nFred Cole, you're going to let him!\"\n",
        "250": "\"Well, aren't you?\nHow can you help yourself?\"\n\"I called him Brother.\n",
        "251": "Why did I call him that?\"\n\"It's right enough.\nThat's all you ever heard him called round here.\n",
        "252": "He seems to have lost off his Christian name.\"\n\"Christian enough I should call that myself.\nHe took no notice, did he? Well, at least\n",
        "253": "I didn't use it out of love of him,\nThe dear knows. I detest the thought of him\nWith his ten children under ten years old.\nI hate his wretched little Racker Sect,\nAll's ever I heard of it, which isn't much.\n",
        "254": "But that's not saying---- Look, Fred Cole, it's\ntwelve,\nIsn't it, now? He's been here half an hour.\nHe says he left the village store at nine.\nThree hours to do four miles\u2014-a mile an hour\nOr not much better. Why, it doesn't seem\n",
        "255": "As if a man could move that slow and move.\nTry to think what he did with all that time.\nAnd three miles more to go!\"\n",
        "256": "\"Don't let him go.\nStick to him, Helen. Make him answer you.\nThat sort of man talks straight on all his life\nFrom the last thing he said himself, stone deaf\nTo anything anyone else may say.\n",
        "257": "I should have thought, though, you could make him\nhear you.\"\n\"What is he doing out a night like this?\nWhy can't he stay at home?\"\n",
        "258": "\"He had to preach.\"\n\"It's no night to be out.\"\n\"He may be small,\nHe may be good, but one thing's sure, he's tough.\"\n",
        "259": "\"And strong of stale tobacco.\"\n\"He'll pull through.\"\n\"You only say so. Not another house\n",
        "260": "Or shelter to put into from this place\nTo theirs. I'm going to call his wife again.\"\n\"Wait and he may. Let's see what he will do.\nLet's see if he will think of her again.\n",
        "261": "But then I doubt he's thinking of himself.\nHe doesn't look on it as anything.\"\n\"He shan't go--there!\"\n",
        "262": "\"It is a night, my dear.\"\n\"One thing: he dicing drag God into it.\"\n\"He don't consider it a case for God.\"\n",
        "263": "\"You think so, do you? You don't know the kind.\nHe's getting up a miracle this minute.\nPrivately\u2014-to himself, right now, he's thinking\nHe'll make a case of it if he succeeds,\nBut keep still if he fails.\"\n",

        "268": "And save his life.\u2014-All right, come in, Meserve\nSit down, sit down. How did you find the horses?\"\n\"Fine, fine.\"\n",
        "269": "\"And ready for some more? My wife here\nSays it won't do. You've got to give it up.\"\n\"Won't you to please me? Please! If I say please?\n",
        "270": "Mr. Meserve, I'll leave it to _your_ wife.\nWhat _did_ your wife say on the telephone?\"\nMeserve seemed to heed nothing but the lamp\nOr something not far from it on the table.\n",

        "472": "And many must have seen him make\nHis wild descent from there one night,\n'Cross lots, 'cross walls, 'cross everything,\nDescribing rings of lantern light.\nBetween the house and barn the gale\nGot him by something he had on\nAnd blew him out on the icy crust\nThat cased the world, and he was gone!\nWalls were all buried, trees were few:\nHe saw no stay unless he stove\nA hole in somewhere with his heel.\n",
        "473": "But though repeatedly he strove\nAnd stamped and said things to himself,\nAnd sometimes something seemed to yield,\nHe gained no foothold, but pursued\nHis journey down from field to field.\nSometimes he came with arms outspread\nLike wings, revolving in the scene\nUpon his longer axis, and\nWith no small dignity of mien.\nFaster or slower as he chanced,\nSitting or standing as he chose,\nAccording as he feared to risk\nHis neck, or thought to spare his clothes,\nHe never let the lantern drop.\n",
        "474": "And some exclaimed who saw afar\nThe figures he described with it,\n\"I wonder what those signals are\nBrown makes at such an hour of night!\nHe's celebrating something strange.\nI wonder if he's sold his farm,\nOr been made Master of the Grange.\"\n",
        "475": "He reeled, he lurched, he bobbed, he checked;\nHe fell and made the lantern rattle\n(But saved the light from going out).\nSo half-way down he fought the battle\nIncredulous of his own bad luck.\nAnd then becoming reconciled\nTo everything, he gave it up\nAnd came down like a coasting child.\n",
        "476": "\"Well\u2014-I-\u2014be----\" that was all he said,\nAs standing in the river road,\nHe looked back up the slippery slope\n(Two miles it was) to his abode.\nSometimes as an authority\nOn motor-cars, I'm asked if I\nShould say our stock was petered out,\nAnd this is my sincere reply:\nYankees are what they always were.\nDon't think Brown ever gave up hope\nOf getting home again because\nHe couldn't climb that slippery slope;\nOr even thought of standing there\nUntil the January thaw\nShould take the polish off the crust.\n",
        "477": "He bowed with grace to natural law,\nAnd then went round it on his feet,\nAfter the manner of our stock;\nNot much concerned for those to whom,\nAt that particular time o'clock,\nIt must have looked as if the course\nHe steered was really straight away\nFrom that which he was headed for\u2014-\nNot much concerned for them, I say.\nBut now he snapped his eyes three times;\nThen shook his lantern, saying, \"Ile's\n'Bout out!\" and took the long way home\nBy road, a matter of several miles.\n",
        "478": "VIII\nREVELATION\nWe make ourselves a place apart\nBehind light words that tease and flout,\nBut oh, the agitated heart\nTill someone really find us out.\nA pity if the case require\n(Or so we say) that in the end\nWe speak the literal to inspire\nThe understanding of a friend.\nBut so with all, from babes that play\nAt hide-and-seek to God afar,\nSo all who hide too well away\nMust speak and tell us where they are.\n",
        "479": "STORM-FEAR\nWhen the wind works against us in the dark,\nAnd pelts with snow\nThe lower chamber window on the east,\nAnd whispers with a sort of stifled bark,\nThe beast,\n\"Come out! Come out!\"\u2014-\nIt costs no inward struggle not to go,\nAh, do!\nI count our strength,\nTwo and a child,\nThose of us not asleep subdued to mark\nHow the cold creeps as the fire dies at length,\u2014-\nHow drifts are piled,\nDooryard and road ungraded,\nTill even the comforting barn grows far away,\nAnd my heart owns a doubt\nWhether 'tis in us to arise with day\nAnd save ourselves unaided.\n",
        "480": "BOND AND FREE\nLove has earth to which she clings\nWith hills and circling arms about\u2014-\nWall within wall to shut fear out.\nBut Thought has need of no such things,\nFor Thought has a pair of dauntless wings.\nOn snow and sand and turf, I see\nWhere Love has left a printed trace\nWith straining in the world's embrace.\n",
        "481": "And such is Love and glad to be.\nBut thought has shaken his ankles free.\nThought cleaves the interstellar gloom\nAnd sits in Sirius' disc all night,\nTill day makes him retrace his flight,\nWith smell of burning on every plume,\nBack past the sun to an earthly room.\n",
        "482": "His gains in heaven are what they are.\nYet some say Love by being thrall\nAnd simply staying possesses all\nIn several beauty that Thought fares far\nTo find fused in another star.\nFLOWER-GATHERING\nI left you in the morning,\nAnd in the morning glow,\nYou walked a way beside me\nTo make me sad to go.\n",
        "483": "Do you know me in the gloaming,\nGaunt and dusty grey with roaming?\nAre you dumb because you know me not,\nOr dumb because you know?\nAll for me? And not a question\n",
        "484": "For the faded flowers gay\nThat could take me from beside you\nFor the ages of a day?\nThey are yours, and be the measure\nOf their worth for you to treasure,\nThe measure of the little while\nThat I've been long away.\nRELUCTANCE\nOut through the fields and the woods\nAnd over the walls I have wended;\nI have climbed the hills of view\nAnd looked at the world, and descended;\nI have come by the highway home,\nAnd lo, it is ended.\n",
        "485": "The leaves are all dead on the ground,\nSave those that the oak is keeping\nTo ravel them one by one\nAnd let them go scraping and creeping\nOut over the crusted snow,\nWhen others are sleeping.\nAnd the dead leaves lie huddled and still,\nNo longer blown hither and thither;\nThe last lone aster is gone;\nThe flowers of the witch-hazel wither;\nThe heart is still aching to seek,\nBut the feet question \"Whither?\"\nAh, when to the heart of man\nWas it ever less than a treason\nTo go with the drift of things,\nTo yield with a grace to reason,\nAnd bow and accept the end\nOf a love or a season?\n",
        "486": "INTO MY OWN\nOne of my wishes is that those dark trees,\nSo old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,\nWere not, as 'twere, the merest mask of gloom,\nBut stretched away unto the edge of doom.\nI should not be withheld but that some day\nInto their vastness I should steal away,\nFearless of ever finding open land,\nOr highway where the slow wheel pours the sand.\nI do not see why I should e'er turn back,\nOr those should not set forth upon my track\nTo overtake me, who should miss me here\nAnd long to know if still I held them dear.\n",
        "487": "They would not find me changed from him they\nknew\u2014-\nOnly more sure of all I thought was true.\n"
