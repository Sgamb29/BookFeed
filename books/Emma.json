The want\nof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.

She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston\nhad not a lively concern; and half an hour\u2019s uninterrupted\ncommunication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness\nof private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\n",
        "647": "This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day\u2019s visit might not\nafford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but\nthe very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was\ngrateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of\nMr. Elton\u2019s oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all\nthat was enjoyable to the utmost.\n",
        "648": "The misfortune of Harriet\u2019s cold had been pretty well gone through\nbefore her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to\ngive the history of it, besides all the history of his own and\nIsabella\u2019s coming, and of Emma\u2019s being to follow, and had indeed just\ngot to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his\ndaughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been\nalmost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away\nand welcome her dear Emma.\n",
        "649": "Emma\u2019s project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather\nsorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close\nto her.

For her own sake she could not be rude; and for\nHarriet\u2019s, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even\npositively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was\ngoing on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr.\nElton\u2019s nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard\n",

        "653": "Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma\u2019s resolution of never\nmarrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank\nChurchill, which always interested her. She had frequently\nthought\u2014especially since his father\u2019s marriage with Miss Taylor\u2014that if\nshe _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,\ncharacter and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the\n",
        "654": "families, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be a\nmatch that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.\nWeston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not\nmeaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\nsituation which she believed more replete with good than any she could\nchange it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided\nintention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain\ndegree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in\ntheir friends\u2019 imaginations.\n",
        "655": "With such sensations, Mr. Elton\u2019s civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very\ncross\u2014and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly\npass without bringing forward the same information again, or the\nsubstance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.\u2014So it proved;\u2014for\nwhen happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at\n",

To provide for her otherwise was out of\nColonel Campbell\u2019s power; for though his income, by pay and\nappointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all\nhis daughter\u2019s; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be\nsupplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.\n",

A very few to-morrows stood\nbetween the young people of Highbury and happiness.\n",
        "1739": "Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him.\nMay was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to\nspend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinely\nhoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have\nany thing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.\n",

        "1741": "the Crown was to witness it;\u2014but it would be better than a common\nmeeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his\nentreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,\nfor the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort\nof the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse\nhim, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man\u2019s\ncompany. She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good\ntime, the Randalls party just sufficiently before them.\n",
        "1742": "Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not\nsay much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.\nThey all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it\nshould be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of\nanother carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first,\nwithout great surprize. \u201cSo unreasonably early!\u201d she was going to\nexclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends,\nwho were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr.\n",

She liked his open manners, but a\n",
        "1744": "little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher\ncharacter.\u2014General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man\nwhat he ought to be.\u2014She could fancy such a man. The whole party walked\nabout, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to\ndo, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their\nvarious modes, till other subjects were started, that, though _May_, a\nfire in the evening was still very pleasant.\n",
        "1745": "Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston\u2019s fault that the number of privy\ncouncillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates\u2019s door\nto offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be\nbrought by the Eltons.\n",
        "1746": "Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,\nwhich shewed a mind not at ease.

        "1750": "The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma\nlonged to know what Frank\u2019s first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how\nhe was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of\ngraciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion,\n",
        "1751": "by giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.\nIn a few minutes the carriage returned.\u2014Somebody talked of rain.\u2014\u201cI\nwill see that there are umbrellas, sir,\u201d said Frank to his father:\n\u201cMiss Bates must not be forgotten:\u201d and away he went.

You know I candidly told you\n",
        "1753": "I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely\npleased with him.\u2014You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him a\nvery handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and\napprove\u2014so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.\nYou must know I have a vast dislike to puppies\u2014quite a horror of them.\n",
        "1754": "They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor me\nhad ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very\ncutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them\nmuch better.\u201d\n",
        "1755": "While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston\u2019s attention was chained; but\nwhen she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies\njust arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.\nMrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. \u201cI have no doubt of its being our\n",

        "2682": "which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!\u2014It was likely to be\nas untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a\nconnexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley\u2014or for the\nChurchills\u2014or even for Mr. Elton!\u2014The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached\n",
        "2683": "by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.\nNo objection was raised on the father\u2019s side; the young man was treated\nliberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted\nwith Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully\nacknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could\nbid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet\u2019s\nhappiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he\noffered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and\nimprovement.
