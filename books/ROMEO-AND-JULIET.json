        "66": "Madam, an hour before the worshipp\u2019d sun\nPeer\u2019d forth the golden window of the east,\nA troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,\nWhere underneath the grove of sycamore\nThat westward rooteth from this city side,\nSo early walking did I see your son.\nTowards him I made, but he was ware of me,\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood.\nI, measuring his affections by my own,\nWhich then most sought where most might not be found,\nBeing one too many by my weary self,\nPursu\u2019d my humour, not pursuing his,\nAnd gladly shunn\u2019d who gladly fled from me.\n",
        "67": "MONTAGUE.\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning\u2019s dew,\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\nShould in the farthest east begin to draw\nThe shady curtains from Aurora\u2019s bed,\nAway from light steals home my heavy son,\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\nShuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out\nAnd makes himself an artificial night.\nBlack and portentous must this humour prove,\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\n",

        "76": "Was that my father that went hence so fast?\nBENVOLIO.\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo\u2019s hours?\n",
        "77": "ROMEO.\nNot having that which, having, makes them short.\nBENVOLIO.\n",
        "78": "In love?\nROMEO.\nOut.\n",
        "79": "BENVOLIO.\nOf love?\nROMEO.\n",
        "80": "Out of her favour where I am in love.\nBENVOLIO.\nAlas that love so gentle in his view,\nShould be so tyrannous and rough in proof.\n",
        "81": "ROMEO.\nAlas that love, whose view is muffled still,\nShould, without eyes, see pathways to his will!\nWhere shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\n",
        "82": "Here\u2019s much to do with hate, but more with love:\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\nO anything, of nothing first create!\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!\nMisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\nStill-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\nDost thou not laugh?\nBENVOLIO.\n",
        "83": "No coz, I rather weep.\nROMEO.\nGood heart, at what?\n",
        "84": "BENVOLIO.\nAt thy good heart\u2019s oppression.\nROMEO.\n",
        "85": "Why such is love\u2019s transgression.\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\nWhich thou wilt propagate to have it prest\nWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\n",
        "86": "Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;\nBeing purg\u2019d, a fire sparkling in lovers\u2019 eyes;\nBeing vex\u2019d, a sea nourish\u2019d with lovers\u2019 tears:\nWhat is it else? A madness most discreet,\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\nFarewell, my coz.\n",
        "87": " [_Going._]\nBENVOLIO.\nSoft! I will go along:\nAnd if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\n",
        "88": "ROMEO.\nTut! I have lost myself; I am not here.\nThis is not Romeo, he\u2019s some other where.\n",
        "89": "BENVOLIO.\nTell me in sadness who is that you love?\nROMEO.\n",
        "90": "What, shall I groan and tell thee?\nBENVOLIO.\nGroan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.\n",
        "91": "ROMEO.\nBid a sick man in sadness make his will,\nA word ill urg\u2019d to one that is so ill.\nIn sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\n",
        "92": "BENVOLIO.\nI aim\u2019d so near when I suppos\u2019d you lov\u2019d.\nROMEO.\n",
        "93": "A right good markman, and she\u2019s fair I love.\nBENVOLIO.\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\n",
        "94": "ROMEO.\nWell, in that hit you miss: she\u2019ll not be hit\nWith Cupid\u2019s arrow, she hath Dian\u2019s wit;\nAnd in strong proof of chastity well arm\u2019d,\nFrom love\u2019s weak childish bow she lives uncharm\u2019d.\nShe will not stay the siege of loving terms\nNor bide th\u2019encounter of assailing eyes,\nNor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:\nO she\u2019s rich in beauty, only poor\nThat when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\n",
        "95": "BENVOLIO.\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\nROMEO.\n",
        "96": "She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\nFor beauty starv\u2019d with her severity,\nCuts beauty off from all posterity.\nShe is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,\nTo merit bliss by making me despair.\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\nDo I live dead, that live to tell it now.\n",
        "97": "BENVOLIO.\nBe rul\u2019d by me, forget to think of her.\nROMEO.\n",
        "98": "O teach me how I should forget to think.\nBENVOLIO.\nBy giving liberty unto thine eyes;\nExamine other beauties.\n",
        "99": "ROMEO.\n\u2019Tis the way\nTo call hers, exquisite, in question more.\nThese happy masks that kiss fair ladies\u2019 brows,\nBeing black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;\nHe that is strucken blind cannot forget\nThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\n",
        "100": "Show me a mistress that is passing fair,\nWhat doth her beauty serve but as a note\nWhere I may read who pass\u2019d that passing fair?\nFarewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.\nBENVOLIO.\n",
        "101": "I\u2019ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.\n [_Exeunt._]\nSCENE II. A Street.\n",
        "102": " Enter Capulet, Paris and Servant.\nCAPULET.\nBut Montague is bound as well as I,\nIn penalty alike; and \u2019tis not hard, I think,\nFor men so old as we to keep the peace.\n",
        "103": "PARIS.\nOf honourable reckoning are you both,\nAnd pity \u2019tis you liv\u2019d at odds so long.\nBut now my lord, what say you to my suit?\n",
        "104": "CAPULET.\nBut saying o\u2019er what I have said before.\nMy child is yet a stranger in the world,\nShe hath not seen the change of fourteen years;\nLet two more summers wither in their pride\nEre we may think her ripe to be a bride.\n",
        "105": "PARIS.\nYounger than she are happy mothers made.\nCAPULET.\n",
        "106": "And too soon marr\u2019d are those so early made.\nThe earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,\nShe is the hopeful lady of my earth:\nBut woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,\nMy will to her consent is but a part;\nAnd she agree, within her scope of choice\nLies my consent and fair according voice.\nThis night I hold an old accustom\u2019d feast,\nWhereto I have invited many a guest,\nSuch as I love, and you among the store,\nOne more, most welcome, makes my number more.\n",
        "107": "At my poor house look to behold this night\nEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:\nSuch comfort as do lusty young men feel\nWhen well apparell\u2019d April on the heel\nOf limping winter treads, even such delight\nAmong fresh female buds shall you this night\nInherit at my house. Hear all, all see,\nAnd like her most whose merit most shall be:\nWhich, on more view of many, mine, being one,\nMay stand in number, though in reckoning none.\nCome, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about\n",

        "109": "Find them out whose names are written here! It is written that the\nshoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the\nfisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to\nfind those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what\nnames the writing person hath here writ.

        "899": "Then say at once what thou dost know in this.\nFRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\n",
        "900": "Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo\u2019s faithful wife.\nI married them; and their stol\u2019n marriage day\nWas Tybalt\u2019s doomsday, whose untimely death\nBanish\u2019d the new-made bridegroom from this city;\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin\u2019d.\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\nBetroth\u2019d, and would have married her perforce\nTo County Paris. Then comes she to me,\n",
        "901": "And with wild looks, bid me devise some means\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\nThen gave I her, so tutored by my art,\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\nTo help to take her from her borrow\u2019d grave,\nBeing the time the potion\u2019s force should cease.\n",
        "902": "But he which bore my letter, Friar John,\nWas stay\u2019d by accident; and yesternight\nReturn\u2019d my letter back.

        "903": "She wakes; and I entreated her come forth\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\nAll this I know; and to the marriage\nHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in this\n",
        "904": "Miscarried by my fault, let my old life\nBe sacrific\u2019d, some hour before his time,\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\nPRINCE.\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.\n",
        "905": "Where\u2019s Romeo\u2019s man? What can he say to this?\nBALTHASAR.\nI brought my master news of Juliet\u2019s death,\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\n",
        "906": "This letter he early bid me give his father,\nAnd threaten\u2019d me with death, going in the vault,\nIf I departed not, and left him there.\nPRINCE.\nGive me the letter, I will look on it.\n",
        "907": "Where is the County\u2019s Page that rais\u2019d the watch?\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\nPAGE.\n",
        "908": "He came with flowers to strew his lady\u2019s grave,\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\nPRINCE.\n",
        "909": "This letter doth make good the Friar\u2019s words,\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death.\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\nOf a poor \u2019pothecary, and therewithal\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\nWhere be these enemies?
